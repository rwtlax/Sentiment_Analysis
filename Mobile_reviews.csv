B005WJJKE6,Let me say I wasn't expecting much but this little phone surprised me. I read reviews about bad voice quality but haven't seemed to have that problem at all. Much nicer than the LG Contour (Craptour) in my opinion. I also had to laugh when I walked into a Metro PCS store to see that they were charging $69 for this $39 phone on Amazon.,HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,Unit No Longer supported. According to Metro/Tmobile NO ONE in North America currently supports this phone.,HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,I BROUGHT THIS PHONE FOR MY DAUGHTER A YEAR AGO AND SHE LOVED IT SO MUCH THAT WHEN THE ORIGINAL ONE WAS RAN OVER BY A CAR SHE WAITED 3 MONTHS FOR ME TO FIND HER A NEW ONE. THIS PHONE IS VERY INEXPENSIVE AND DOES EVERY SINGLE THING MY EXPENSIVE PHONE CAN DO.,HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,BUT IT WONT WORK IN WASHINTON BUT THERE ARE PSC OR PCSSTORES IN WASHINGTN LYNWWOD 98036 ZIP CODES 98021,HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,"Its much better then the one I have purchase from Metro PCS. Like this phone better. Haven't update it yet, but will soon be on it.",HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,"I love this phone :D It's an incredible price for such a beautiful phone. Works smoothly and does it's job and looks good while doing it(: lol you can get an MP3 player for the price of this phone and it doubles as one, that's just one way this phone is an incredible value :D I'm really happy with my purchase.",HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,"When I received the phone, I was unable to hook it up. I called customer service and it still wasn't able to be hooked up. I gave up after that. It was a waist of money.",HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,I didn't want to spend alot on a phone and needed just a basic one.This fits all my needs for what I use a phone for.I would recommend this phone highly.,HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,my mom really loves the phone. She loves it for the texting purpose as well because she is a newbie to the texting world. Great Price !,HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,"I'm not longer have this phone,but I got it for a great price.",HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,i love this phone. Its a messaging phone that does its job and more. I think the keyboard is better than the BlackBerry keyboard because its better spaced out. Overall if you text alot you are gonna love it,HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,"my husband loves his phone. He doesn't like the small keyboard, but he loves the fact that he doesn't have to press the same key 4 or 5 times to get the letter or number he wants",HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,This was a waste of my money and time. I waited for this phone for a week and when i got it i called Metro and they said they no longer use these type of phones. This should be taken off the market or ONLY advertised as a PLAY phone. CANNOT BE ACTIVATED.,HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,"MetroPCS is a sucky service to begin with, but if you're struggling financially, you gotta do what you gotta do. Still, this phone was very cute. It makes typing very easy :)",HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,I thought I could take pictures and receive my emails :( Only good thing is the keyboard..I thought it worked like a Blackberry,HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,"Bought this phone for my daughter and she loves this phone!! Plus it was cheap!! If you have a teenager working a part-time job in school and they want a cell phone, Amazon.com is the way to go. Instead of me adding a family plan to my account, she has an account with Metro PCS and it's a month to month plan basis without a contract!!!",HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,"My thumbs get in the way of of the small buttoms,causing some un-anticipated changes with many of the features.And if you wear glasses...your in for some difficult moments. Sorry I should have at least actually had one in my hands to check out the phone before hand.....My Mistake! Fred Smoot",HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,"Reading the other reviews, you must have gotten a better version then I did. Entry level phone that was sold for $ 50 at Metro PCS stores at the time. They now sell a newer version of this phone. We have two of these and they both have the same issues. Battery life is crap with Metro PCS constantly sending you advertising 24 hours a day. If you turn the phone off, the battery keeps a decent charge. Camera is is mediocre, you need to buy a memory card to store video or more then a few pictures. Most annoying issue, the phones will turn off after the first ring on an incoming call. Both our phones have this issue at times ! Phone then reboots for about thirty to sixty seconds.",HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,My 8 year old daughter begged her father until he caved and allowed her to have a phone. We went to Metro and got this phone. For the price it has been worth it. The speaker phone kind of sucks but the rest of it is good. The texting is easy on this phone and it is really easy to download music from my Droid to her phone via Bluetooth. All around it is a GREAT phone for the price.,HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,This phone is horrible. It always freezes and turns off on me for no reason. Im telling you waste of your money. Plus the camera is terrible so is the speaker. I barley can hear anyone when i talk! I dont recoment this phone to anyone!,HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,I have the phone and i like it only that it can't zoom on the phone or see videos on the internet please metro pcs make this phone see videos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,As described.,HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,"This is the best non-smartphone from MetroPCS with very good battery life and features like Mp3 Player, video recording and expandable memory.",HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,"I bought this phone for my son. So far it works great, it hasn't broke and he's happy with it.",HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,This phone dosent have the durablity of the freeform II or III. It worked well but ease of use left more to be desired. the video capture was not all that great.,HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,"Cheaper than on Metro PCS website or store: you save $20 plus taxes. Good nice phone, not a smart phone, don't be decieved, but a very reliable one",HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,"Got this in a $25/month plan from metropcs. It's a great phone, battery lasts longer than the similar Samsung phone (my wife has the samsung, and I took this one). Looks better too! The samsung has voice caller ID (speaking the name of the person who's calling you), this one does not. The samsung has like 3-5 days of battery life. This phone has 5-7 days of battery life; and it lasts longer on a charge playing MP3, than my aged mp3 player (plays ~10 hrs of MP3 with large headphones, possibly longer with small headphones). The equalizer is basic though; not too much variation on settings. Apart from a media player, it has a same mpix camera as the samsung, but the display is noticeably of a slightly lower quality (Samsung's pixels are bigger, with this huawei you can still see the black space inbetween pixels). It has alarm clock, blue tooth, calculator, memo, voice recorder, stopwatch, calendar,and world time. The weather function does not work, because it needs internet. In case you take the more expensive $50 plan you can get single speed internet included, with which you can connect to the internet to download apps (none are free). The rest you get the regular metropcs crap, like 411, my extra's, metro app store. Do know you're only able to receive regular spam (you can disable it) about promotions, but you're not able to go on the internet. If voice dialing is not your thing, then the Huawei is a better buy! $10 cheaper too!",HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B005WJJKE6,i pay 25$ a month!!! thats a deal .. that and because i got the promotion so ha ha ha ha ha ha h ah ah aha,HUAWEI,"August 16, 2021"
B015YCRZ1K,"As an iPhone convert, I was a little skeptical about making the move to Nexus and Android as a whole. I thought the transfer of my data would be hard (it wasn't), and I had a bunch of misconceptions about Android that were ultimately way wrong. I've made the switch and I don't think I'm ever going back. What Google has made is not only the iPhone's cheaper competitor, but also the Android OS as it was made to be; in it's purest form. I've always associated the Android OS with bloatware from carriers, resulting in a not so minimal and often ugly-looking phone. I've also never experienced Android on a premium device, meaning that it left a bad taste in my mouth when I used the OS on some cheap devices. But with Nexus, you get the real Android experience. Everything is buttery smooth, fast, fluid, intuitive, and most importantly, customizable. From the ground up, you can make your phone the way you want it to be. It's up to you how you want your phone to work. Anyways, enough about the OS. Let's talk about the phone itself and what makes it great. 1. Price & Value I buy my electronics for the long haul. The 6P is built superbly and has Gorilla Glass protecting its front and back. Despite what other say, I also find it easy to hold and don't worry about losing my grip on it. The 6P is sturdy, sleek, and unique all at the same time. I also want a good deal too. The 6P delivers on both of those fronts. It's main competitor, the iPhone 6s Plus, is $649 unlocked, and that's for a 16GB model. My 32GB 6P cost around ~$400 after some discounts at Best Buy. There's no doubt in my mind that the 6P is one of the best deals on the market right now. 2. Fingerprint Scanner The placement of the fingerprint scanner (top of the back) is perfect. It's just real natural to place your finger there to unlock your phone, nothing awkward about it. You can also log multiple fingerprints too, meaning that you could pick up the phone with either hand and unlock it. If you prefer not having to enter a password, your prints can be used to buy apps from the Play Store and open certain apps. The scanner is also one of the fastest, if not the fastest out there. The scanner is also incredibly accurate as well. In the few days I've used it, I can count on my hand the number of times it's incorrectly read my print, and that's probably user error. Simply put, Google is killing it here. 3. Camera Talk about a nice camera. I'll let the pictures I took do the talking. While Google's camera app leaves a little to be desired at times, it gets the job done. The camera performs great in all kinds of lighting, and is adept at adjusting to its surroundings. 12 MP is as good as it gets right now in smartphones, and while it's not DSLR-quality, your Instagram feed will still look good. Speaking of DSLR, I took some photos with my Nikon D40 for comparison. The first two are Nexus. *the photos below were untouched.* 4. Design/Size First of all, this phone isn't big at all. No, you don't need to be Lana from Archer to use this phone. I upgraded from a meager iPhone 4s, and was quite concerned about this phone's seemingly gargantuan size. But once you get it in hand, you'll see that you were worried about nothing. It's hard to explain, but you'll never want to have a small phone again after your first day with the 6P. It just feels right. Once you learn how to cradle the phone the right way, you'll forget about the phone's size. If you're still worried about the size, check out this site to compare the 6P to your current phone. http://www.phonearena.com/phones/size I will concede that on some apps, it's mildly inconvenient to stretch your finger all the way across the screen, but this is a small tradeoff for the big beautiful screen that you get. I gushed about the design a bit earlier, but it really is the cat's balls. The front-facing speaker is loud and clear, and won't muffle unless you put your phone face down. On the top, the earpiece produces great call quality and makes it easy to hear your caller. The phone is easy to hold, and the power/volume buttons don't get in the way. The aluminum and metal build make the phone feel and look premium, and it seems as if Google didn't cut any corners in designing this unit. 5. Battery Life A lot of critics have been gushing about this, and rightfully so. Without adjusting any of my settings, or using any battery management apps, the 6P can easily make it through a day and then some of heavy use. This varies of course, but I'm content as long as my phone makes it though the day without needing a charge. If you mess with your settings and/or use apps, the 6P can easily last you a couple of days if you manage the battery effectively. You can also easily analyze which apps are effecting battery performance. Using Google's official cable/adaptor, it takes about a little more than an hour for my phone to go from zero to one-hundred. That's from zero to one-hundred real quick. While the whole USB-C setup isn't exactly ubiquitous yet, it's fast and great for data transfer. The USB-C is reversible and can also be used to reverse charge, meaning that your 6P could charge someone else's USB-C device. 6. Software/Hardware As I said before, Android is what you make of it. Marshmallow is a great OS, and that's amplified by the fact that Google gives you no bloatware or add-ons. I believe that out of the box, only around 3 GB of the 32 total GB is occupied. It's the purest form of Android, how it was meant to be. Everything flows great. Google Now and it's cards are also really convenient once it gets to learn about you. The animations are smooth, glitchless, and the phone is fast thanks to 3GB of RAM. Nexus users also get Android updates first before the general populace, meaning your phone is up-to-date. You can expect these Nexus-only benefits to grow in the future as Google makes it like their iPhone. The Nexus is also equipped with real good hardware. The Snapdragon 810 processor, 3GB of RAM, and Adreno 430 GPU all work in harmony to keep your experience with games, apps, and multitasking lag-free. The Samsung AMOLED 1440 display is also one of the best screens on the market right now. Heck, the pictures I took looked way better on my Nexus before I uploaded them on my laptop. Colors are bright and vibrant, and video is top-class. The brightness also has a wide range. At its lowest, the screen is even a little too dark for nighttime use. At it's brightest, it can contend with the bright sun. 7. Cellular Data I've been using Google's Project Fi thus far, and I'm really impressed. I got my SIM card in the mail and a nice phone stand LEGO set from them in the mail free of charge. Porting my number over took about five minutes, and my service has been great. Fi uses T-Mobile and Sprint for data, and places calls over Wi-Fi when possible by using encryption/VPN. Using my phone out and about almost seemed faster than my in-home Internet, and calls over both Wi-Fi and cell were clear and great quality. You can also manage your data in the Settings by alerting you when your data used reaches a certain amount, and you can even set a limit that will turn off your phone's data when exceeded. 8. Misses While the Nexus 6P is great by almost every standard in the book, here are a few things I wish this phone would have. - wireless charging - dual SIM port - expandable micro SD - removable battery - different screenshot option (Pressing power/volume down at the same time is awkward. Thankfully you can long press the home button and press the share button on the left to bypass this.) Overall, the Nexus 6P is probably the best value on the phone market. You've got top-of-the-line performance at a significant discount from its main competitor in the Apple 6s Plus, and you get Android in its greatest form. With a great camera, display, hardware, software, and preferred treatment from Google, the Nexus 6P should be in your pocket. PICS #1 & #2: shot with Nexus 6P; no editing #3 & 4: shot with Nikon D40 DSLR; no editing #5: Backside of 6P #6: My gross hand #7: Backside with camera/mic/scanner #8: Side (SIM port on top left) #9: My home screen. Just showing what cool things you can do with Android. Nova Launcher Prime and Moonshine are the launcher/icon combo I used. #10: Second screen. Same stuff. #11: What the battery screen looks like. Great for analyzing when and what effects your battery.",HUAWEI,"February 7, 2021"
B015YCRZ1K,"I've owned this phone for years. I bought it from Google, I still use it. I bought this refurbished version for my child. Good phone, low cost. Bad move. The battery is garbage, The phone goes from 100% to 50% in two hours, then immediately dies. Indicative of a bad/old battery. Very obvious the phone was not refurbished but simplly repackaged and and sold. Don't waste your money. Also refurbished unit is not sold by Huawei. So feel free it insult Amazon for for enabling fraud.",HUAWEI,"February 7, 2021"
B015YCRZ1K,"My phone is at the same 1.5 year mark as everyone else and it's shutting down at 25+% battery. Also It'll show in the battery settings that it's used about 4% of the battery, but the battery itself is at 81%. That being said, I unplugged it from the charger at 5 am, took it to work and put it in my locker where it's sat with GPS, bluetooth and everything else off. I then check at 9 am and voila it's at 81% after having done nothing for 4 hours. This has become much more apparent over the course of the last few months, along with a host of other issues that are cropping up (similar to the other 1 star comments) As for the phone itself: The camera takes pretty good pictures and has a photo-sphere function that I love to use for my 3D modeling (not a selling point for everyone). I've never had major issues with the camera other than that. Software was working good for the most part up until these battery issues showed up and now certain things like Google Drive will re-start uploads from 1-2 months ago that never finished due to connectivity or something and just show ""UPLOADING"" till I restart the phone. Cell service has been decent but on the spotty side if I do say so myself. I switched from a Sprint phone to this thinking that I'd get the best of both worlds and it seems like I get less coverage than either sprint or t-mobile (which Fi is supposedly using both). My guess is that both companies are giving Google Fi their worst bandwidth/frequencies at a discount rate. Either way, I drop one of every 5 calls and wi-fi calling will cut in and out randomly on my phone while my roommates are also using the wi-fi calling on apple or Samsung products and not having any issues. All of this being said, I don't call most of the time and I really like paying only for what I use, and usually go under my 2Gb limit for the month. So there's that. In Summary: I wish now that I'd spend the extra $50 to $100 dollars on a manufacturer that would've made this phone with more quality parts. I like the phone in general and feel cheated having to spend another $5-600 getting a new phone seeing as this one is becoming unusable after only 1.5 years. Bummer.",HUAWEI,"February 7, 2021"
B015YCRZ1K,"Great Phone. Miserable customer service from Huawei. Avoid this purchase and pay the extra through the Google store. My phone boot looped a month ago, and I contacted Huawei who initated an RMA (phone in warranty), but never sent a shipping label. Ive contacted them five times and still don't have the label. They have gone radio silent.",HUAWEI,"February 7, 2021"
B015YCRZ1K,Battery problems with phone shutting down randomly even with 95% battery charged. Ordered phone in March of 2016 and used it until September of 2017 when the problem started happening all of a sudden. This is a known issue with this phone and neither Google nor the manufacturer want to acknowledge it or Do anything about it. Others who purchased this phone directly through the Google Store have had their phones replaced immediately with Google pixel XL after reporting this problem however if you purchase this phone through Amazon you get no support from the manufacturer who does not want to acknowledge the problem. Calling to manufacture these days gets you put on hold for a long time until you are given a message that the support services are too busy and you just get disconnected without being able to reach anyone or leave voicemail. I will never order another Google phone from Amazon North from this manufacturer ever again.,HUAWEI,"February 7, 2021"
B015YCRZ1K,"I owned the Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 done by LG and loved them, so fo rme it was a no brainer to get this product. However it was not done by LG, it was done by Huawei. And of course Huawei offers a guarantee of 12 months (1 year), 12.5 months after, 2 weeks ago, my phone started to shut down when there was still 20% of battery life. Now after fully charges, and 10 minutes of use, it is turning down by itself. I have to walk around having the phone connected to external charger. I have not contacted Huawei yet as i know for sure they will tell me, sorry 12 months is up. Hope somebody reads this and assist me as this is unbearable. I was always happy with Nexus phones and this is a huge let down. UPDATE: I have contacted customer services, a guy name Rick told me that I was still under the guarantee. I'm sending it to have it fixed. I hope they do. BTW, Rick was a great help. UPDATE 2: So i sent the item and got it back ""repaired"". I used it 3 days with no issues and it turn off by itself and now is stuck in initial Google screen. I have to send it back to customer service, however they are making me pay for the UPS as i am currently in Puerto Rico. This is really making me think to not ever get a Huawei device.",HUAWEI,"February 7, 2021"
B015YCRZ1K,"Huawei Phones were built with faulty main computer boards that crash to an unsolvable boot loop in a short period of time. Calling the product manufacturer line at 888-548-2934 the manufacturer's official stance is if your $500 product is out of warranty for a year and this known fatal design flaw kicks in at 13 months (which it will) they do not stand behind their product and the only resolution offered is for you to buy a new phone from them. I would give them a zero if I could. I do not mind paying for quality, in this case they are charging a premium for a known faulty device and do not stand behind what they make. Shame on Huawei and shame on Google for this scam.",HUAWEI,"February 7, 2021"
B015YCRZ1K,"PLEASE PLEASE BEWARE of this device. I must admit that I first I loved it but in less than a year, it became useless. Just go on the Google, and you'll see there is a known issue with this device's software and battery . It leads to quick battery drain followed by the device shutting down (often with 20-25% battery left). Other customers get locked into a bootloop. Both Google and Huawei acknowledge the issue but that doesn't help you if this phone is your only means of communications. If you purchase directly from Google, they will do an immediate exchange but dealing with Huawei can be a nightmare or be a process that takes up to a month. Huawei rep freely admitted that the device they send back to you might encounter the problem again. Google support just tells you they are aware of the problem but that is no fix. Unlike Apple, you have no physical store to go to. You have no loaner phone to use while you send the phone away for months. Im so disappointed and angry with this fiasco as the owner of the device has no landline, needs phone access to communicate with medical professionals or even take an Uber. Long story short, this phone is too good to be true. If you havent encountered the problems yet, be glad. They will come for most people. Google says the problem involves software updates but after all this time, there are no fixes.",HUAWEI,"February 7, 2021"
B015YCRZ1K,"I bought this on the recommendation of my son (works in IT support), and after checking online reviews. This phone exceeded expectations. I switched from a Blackberry 9930 to the Nexus 6P. After just a few hours the phone was personalized for me: several email accounts, messaging, the web (with all bookmarks), contact list, transferring MP3's and AVI's, etc. The camera, display and audio quality are great! I snapped a photo of a flower arrangement from 4' away in a dimly lit room - someone said it looked like a high def painting. The detail and color/tonal balance was incredible for a flash photo. I know there isn't any image stabilization but that's not an issue. I really like the lack of bloatware. As a result, customization is easy - just read the online manuals and FAQs. Things work well because there's simple consistency across the phone's operation - no third party quirks to deal with or get rid of. Highly recommended. I wish I had bought one earlier. I also wish I'd bought the 128 GB version instead of the 64 GB version. Edit: after 1 year and 2 months there is a major problem with the battery (warranty expired last month 😠). Because I ""charged it too much"" the battery expanded, pushing the transparent screen face out of it's case. It was going to cost me $80! Unacceptable for such an expensive phone (at least it used to be expensive). I called Huawei and returned for service. After a week my phone is still not back. I called Huawei and they basically said, ""That's our policy, live with it."" Their phone support is terrible! I wish they could speak English. Read the many one star reviews before buying this phone!!! NOT RECOMMENDED!!!",HUAWEI,"February 7, 2021"
B015YCRZ1K,"To everyone considering this phone or another Huawei product - here is your warning. I purchased this new directly from Amazon last year, the phone is still under warranty recently noticed the metal frame around the power button the volume button crimping/bending - simple issue I thought? Called Huawei support - sent them six pictures of the phone at their request - NO REPAIR - they consider it ""physical damage"" - even though the frame on their phone failed. Phone has been in case and protected since day one. Beware you are on your own even if your phone is still COVERED by warranty. Terrible service. Never will I buy one of their products again.",HUAWEI,"February 7, 2021"

When talking, the phone just hung up, the network goes off frequently and the other person cannot hear me at all. Please do not buy Chinese phones, they have a lot of issues.

B01COSAKMI,Was a exelent Phone but Just for any telephone company dont work,HUAWEI,"May 31, 2021"
B01COSAKMI,"The hardware is great, But the software is messed up big way by Huawei. Great sound, speed, and screen. Enough charge for a day. Needs a home button! Give me the home butto CONS: it has a customized Mashmallow Android - I really dislike how they messed up the options - things are impossible to find, access to the files via USB is now more restricted than before - so my automatic transfer doesn't work anymore... Many inconveniences. CONS: the screen is dimmer, than Galaxy, it is hard to use in the California daylight. PROS: pretty fast, the sound is amazingly loud and deep. OLDER REVIEW I often use the phone while driving or riding or walking the dogs and use hadrware home button - to pick up calls. Now there is no way to pick up calls via hardware, one has to look at the screen and even worse - the new system sometimes requies the user to slide and other times to click on a green circle to pick up a call. Very user unfriendly. I missed several calls just because of that. PROS: great speakers! It sounds much deaper than my old Samsung Galaxy S5. Great deep sound, pretty loud. Much faster than S5, I like the size and the feel. CONS: give me back removable battery design! I used to carry 5 charged batteries with me. Now, the buttery is stationary. So one has to carry an external charger/battery - much worse.",HUAWEI,"May 31, 2021"

But really surprised the ips is way better than expected. + 6 inch screen Long lasting battery Quick charging Fastest processor Fingerprint reader is accurate Came with phone cover and screen protector applied. Nice metal body - 3gb ram in not enough sometimes.keep clearing memory Camera is average. Especially video is bad in dim lights Rooting is complex. I used to root phones for more customisation,HUAWEI,"May 31, 2021"

B01IVV7W8M,"I loved this phone. It worked great, it looked amazing...then it stopped charging. I sent it in for repair to 2.5 weeks which is difficult when I use my phone for Work! They provide no loaner or options and have no local repair places. Received my phone back and I finally programmed everything back in to find out the charging situation WASN'T fixed. ALSO people can only hear me when I use speakerphone. So I know they attempted a repair but it is now worse. I have asked for a replacement unit and they refuse saying sending it for repair is their only way to proceed. After 6 month of the first issue my phone remains broken as they won't respond to emails and when speaking with them on the phone they say they will turn it into an upgraded case and have someone contact me, B.S.. I have heard from no one. I took my pictures to prove the phone isn't damaged for the second time and for two months have been waiting for shipping label to be sent. While it was repaired 10 days later I called in and they couldn't find my information. The person I spoke with wasn't even sure what my phone was there for. I asked if it was fixed and he said ""it sure is!"" I asked what they did and he said he had no idea. I explained the situation with it and he stated he was sure they replaced the battery. A little bit or irony. Their motto, ""Honor - For the brave!"" I know exactly what that means now. Be very brave if you go down the honor path!",HUAWEI,"August 5, 2021"
B01IVV7W8M,"What a fantastic phone for a little over $300! I previously had the iPhone 6 and then a Samsung Galaxy S7, this device exceeds the performance of either of those phones. It's snappy fast, hotspots well (I live in a rural area and my phone is my only internet!) and has a high quality display. This device packs a lot of great features into a small and affordable package. I put a Sparin clear case on it so the white shows off. People frequently comment on how sleek the phone looks and ask what it is. It's running the latest version of android and I'm extremely pleased. I will comment that while the camera on this is very good, it's not great in low light. In fact, the S7 camera was a superior camera but again...for the money you can't beat this phone. I've included a few shots from the camera so you can see image quality. the photos on the creek were snapped while the phone was in a watertight bag so that has a minor impact on the image quality as well, giving it a slightly hazy effect. This is not a splash resistant or waterproof phone as the Samsung S7 was or some of the Motorolas that are now available. If you're careful with your phone, it shouldn't be necessary but it's important to note. I selected the phone for the 64 GB harddrive storage and for the excellent processor and speed and it does not disappoint. This has the best fingerprint scanner on any phone I've used. I added my index and middle fingerprints so I have some flexibility depending on how I'm holding the phone and added my husband's fingerprint as well so if I'm driving he can operate my phone (Google Maps, etc.). It unlocks in an instant, super fast! Overall, highly recommended android phone for AT&T. I understand it's also compatible with T-Mobile but I have not tested it with that provider as they have poor coverage in the rural area I live.",HUAWEI,"August 5, 2021"
B01IVV7W8M,"I researched phones for weeks before deciding on this one. I was focused on finding the best camera, speed, and network quality that I could for my price point. This phone exceeded my expectations in all of these areas. It was the best quality for the price that I found, hands down. To be honest, I am disappointed by the camera in low lighting. But when the lighting is moderate to good, the camera is excellent. There are SO MANY features in the camera, I haven't even had a chance to go through all of them yet. I like the ""beauty mode"" setting. ""Time-lapse"" and ""Light Painting"" are also really cool. Speedy phone. Apps open seamlessly. 64 gigs is great, so much room for everything. The screen is gorgeous. Vivid, bright colors. I activated this phone with T-Mobile and have had great call quality. I've gotten several comments from people on how clear my voice sounds, and I have noticed a significant difference in the quality of their voices as well. It's a beautiful phone. Sleek and smooth. Somewhat fragile, but just make sure to invest in a good case and screen protector.",HUAWEI,"August 5, 2021"
B01IVV7W8M,"To start with, if I could have returned this while it was under the 30 day return from Amazon I would have, but it didn't start having issues until about day 40. It started with the GPS not working after it had completed a route and then you tried routing back home. It simply will not get a lock and would estimate the position , which is not good while you are driving. After a few days of this it finally just quit working. I contacted Huawei's service department and it took 2 days to get them to issue an RMA to get the unit repaired. They sent a call tag for me to return the item and said it would take 7 to 10 days. It took a total of 16 days for me to receive the unit back (their repair center was getting shipped 10 miles from me) . It worked for about a week and ended up with the same issue. This model is known after I started searching for having issues with the GPS. I called and requested that Huawei issue me a new phone and I would return this one so that I didn't have to be without a phone for an additional 2 weeks as well as the fact I don't think it can be repaired or it would have been fixed correctly the first time. I was informed that they had to go through the RMA process and I didn't have any other options. So I am now writing my dissatisfaction with their company, and that if you need service, know that you are going to have to wait a long time and there is no confidence it will be fixed correctly. Other than that, the phone worked ok. I have been underwhelmed with the UI - it is proprietary and is ok, but definitely different trying to adjust from stock android UI. Battery life was above average and the phone ran programs quickly with no issues. I would not recommend this unit and suggest you search for GPS issues for Honor 8 before spending this much money on a phone.",HUAWEI,"August 5, 2021"
B01IVV7W8M,"This is by far the best phone that I've owned. Aesthetically, it is beautiful; it takes amazing photos, is lightning fast, it's proprietary GUI is is awesome, but that is a very subjective thing -- some might like it and some might not. The saving grace for that is that you can still use custom launchers like Nova Launcher, and with 7.x.x (Nougat), it gives you more control over the EMUI/Interface. The full glass encasement of the phone really puts emphasis on this phone's beauty. I wouldn't cover the look of this phone by using a solid color case -- I'd suggest using the Sparin crystal clear case; it has reinforced corners, slightly raised edges so you can lay your phone face down without fear of scratching it, and they come in packs of two for $7.99 with free one day shipping for prime members. As for a screen protector, I spent about a week researching screen protectors and trying them all out. It's was a bit harder to find a decent screen protector for this phone because it has a beveled 2.5 dimensional screen, but after trial and error, I have found that the Nacodex glass screen protector does an amazing job at covering as much as possible without compromising the integrity of the screen protector. If you want a non-glass screen protector, radipest and dmax have thin anti scratch screen protectors that allows full coverage of the screen due to the screen protector's malleability. On top of that, this phone has some awesome hidden features like being able to assign functions to 'knuckle gestures'. An example of this would be when I knock on my screen with my knuckles, it takes a screen shot of the screen, or if I take and hold my knuckle on the screen, followed by dragging it around, I draw a frame around a specific part of the screen, I can take a cropped screenshot of whatever I drew the frame around. There are a ton more hidden and innovative features on this phone that I'm finding. Also, the finger print scanner works flawlessly even when holding the phone awkwardly. Overall, this phone is amazing.",HUAWEI,"August 5, 2021"
B01IVV7W8M,"DO NOT BUY; I loved this phone, it honestly became my all-time favorite phone. However, the phone lasted me exactly 8 months. The motherboard went out on me, and note that I take care of my phone really well, when I called Huawei all I received was ""We're very sorry, we believe you, there's nothing we can do."" I was still under warranty, yet they didn't help me, give me a discount on a new one, etc. I don't want this happening to anyone else, I was on the phone for 1hr with a manager only to feel hopeless. Pay the extra money, while I understand that sometimes electronics give out, I expect some kind of service to the customers who spend their hard earned money on their products.",HUAWEI,"August 5, 2021"
B01IVV7W8M,"03/14/2017 Pistola de Oro 64 (Gold) This is to augment my other phone. For the price I made sense to have more memory. More pleased than ever with this device. Hope they both last. The OS is actually pretty intuitive. Coming from my work phone iPhone 6s it is comparable. That's not a bad thing. . 02/23/2017 Just did the Nougat 7.0 update. Seamless. Pixel doesn't doesn't have the pressure, sensitive fingerprint reader. Touch to open. A single press and it's a flashlight, double press messaging hold and it opens chrome. This phone is brilliant! ​ For me, it does everything I want seamlessly and reliably. I am forbidden from using various sites at work. So while far from being a super user I do use my phone lots. The first week has been uneventful. ATT set me up with a nano sim for free. What really stands out for me is the HiSuite desktop user interface. While your phone is connected to your desktop or laptop via the UsbC cable, you can access photo's, contacts, edit apps, even message and watch videos on your desktop display! As far as the phone itself what's not to like? The BlueTooth connection to my Pioneer car stereo is reliable. Pandora sounds great and it thumps my subs. Google voice works ok. I like this phone. Devices reviews are so subjective. Everyone want's something different. I would say this phone does it all pretty well.",HUAWEI,"August 5, 2021"
B01IVV7W8M,"Absolutely love this phone. There are a few quirks here and there that you may have to get used to. The EMUI overlay Huawei put on Android is nice, but really resembles iOS in certain aspects. Having said that, in my opinion, this would be the perfect phone for someone looking to get the heck away from Apple (which I regularly encourage everyone to do). The layout is simple, but you are still able to customize a lot of different things, per the norm with Android. The camera is not impressive in low light, but in daylight it shines. Granted, it's probably not on par with the top of the line 2017 and 2018 phones, but this is a middle of the road 2016 phone, so that's expected. To put it in perspective though, the daylight photos on this phone absolutely blow away the photos on my recently deceased iPhone 6s. That's not saying much, as the 6s sucked on so many different levels. It reinforced my allegiance to Android haha. I digress... If you're looking for a high quality phone without the high end sticker price, this is the phone for you. It's also a gorgeous phone, so much so that I'm having a hard time putting a case on it because I want to leave it as is... but I don't want my phone to break haha. In comparison (and I'm not expert, but I've used both iOS and android, flagships and non-flagships over the years), the Honor 8 beats out the i6s in almost every category I can think of. Battery is equal to or longer lasting than the 6s, and charges a lot faster using the Huawei rapid charger (about the same with a 3rd party adapter) External storage option... need I say more, APPLE?! Beautiful screen. I didn't notice a difference in this screen to the 6s honestly, but I do need to revisit the eye doctor soon, so take that with a grain of salt. Perfect size for the average joe, 5.2"" screen is a great middle ground. I've had recent phones ranging from 4.7"" to 5.7"" and I'm quite happy with the Honor 8's 5.2"" screen. The Honor 8 beats out the 6s in speed all day long. The only two quirks I have yet to figure out is why my Plantronics Voyager Legend headset keeps regressing back to not having smart features. One day I'll have voice-command options on it, and the next day it won't work until I play with the settings off and on. Could be a phone thing, could be a headset thing. Haven't figured it out yet. The other quirk is that many apps won't send you notifications inherently. This is due to Huawei's crazy abrasive battery saving techniques. There's a simple setting you have to switch (again, just google it and they'll walk you through it). In all fairness the Honor 8 is 11 months NEWER of a phone, so these comparisons are comparing a newer phone to an older one. But, given the fact that the 6s is a ""flagship"" device and cost at least 50% more when it came out, I thought they were worthy of comparing.",HUAWEI,"August 5, 2021"
B01IVV7W8M,"This is NOT a technical review but rather the kind of review the everyday user might find useful. I bought this phone after my 2nd Gen. Moto X started giving me problems. First off the phone is GORGEOUS! It has glass front and back panels which I love but makes it SLIPPERY. Be sure to buy a case if only to address this. The phone at first glance can be mistaken for an iPhone and it has the same quality heft and feel to it. Many people have asked me what kind of iPhone is, so if that would bug you then don't get it. I didn't like the Huawei ""EMUI"" launcher so I installed the familiar Google Now and its just better, it's what I'm used to. The battery lasts ME about a full 10 hours of average use. I'm talking checking email, directions, some vids, slight web browsing and oh yeah, phone calls and texting. Fast charging is supported and works GREAT! I didn't time it or anything but it's fast. The buttons work well and the USB C AND headphone jack (yay!) are both welcome! The screen is bright and nice to look at, the speaker needs to be a little louder when playing music or in a speakerphone call but just plug in those earbuds! It syncs well with my 2014 Nissan Altima AND 2016 Nissan Versa Bluetooth systems and works flawlessly. The camera is OK in regular mode and ""good enough"" in Pro mode, I'm not concerned about photos from my phone so if this is an issue for you research before you buy. The last pic I post of the gorge will be from this phone. I installed ""Auideas Huawei Honor 8 Screen Protector Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Huawei Honor 8 Screen Protector [2-Pack]"" so you can see an edge around the perimeter of the phone screen as it does not fully cover the glass. Also installed is the ""Spigen Rugged Armor Honor 8 Case with Resilient Shock Absorption for Huawei Honor 8 2016 - Black""",HUAWEI,"August 5, 2021"
B01IVV7W8M,"I love this phone and I am so glad I found this instead of the usual Samsung Galaxy models I am used to. I've noticed there were some bad reviews but also good reviews so I went ahead and bought this anyway. I've had this for more or less half a year and this phone is still functioning fine. The battery life is still great and lasts for most of the day, though definitely it was better the first few months I had it (would last until the next day!). I bought a glass screen protector and a somewhat thin phone case, and have dropped it a few times from a table straight to the ground but it still works fine and there's no cracks. Not sure if this is waterproof off the top of my head but I have used the phone in the shower (just for music) and it has gotten a little wet before and it is still fine as well (definitely don't sink your phone to test anyway). The reason why I personally don't believe it deserves full 5 stars is because the camera isn't as crisp as I thought it would be, the default UI setup is not as practical and easy-to-use (but can be customized to your preference at least, just extra work), and I also noticed that there's no option to encrypt your data files on this Huawei phone. I've researched around and found that Huawei phones (not sure about all models) do not provide distinct encryption of data files versus normal Android phones with the Lollipop/Marshmellow update which is encrypted by default. I mean nonetheless Android encryption is probably trash and easily crackable anyway, but I do think security is important and you potential buyers should ensure some form of protection. There are workarounds online and certain apps that can still secure your stuff, so this shouldn't be a big deal but those extra steps are a little ugh. And forgive me if I am wrong, I am not exactly well-versed in tech as I should be.",HUAWEI,"August 5, 2021"

B078T2T2FL,"Edit as of February 20, 2019: My Mate 10 Pro, C567 (US version) just received the update to EMUI 9 (Android 9 Pie). With this update I received better AI, improved camera (better bokeh, better auto brightness/contrast settings), Super SlowMo (960 fps), Face Unlock and dozens of other tweaks and improvements. Bluetooth issues seem to be fixed as well. Only HiVision (AI objects recognition) and GPU Turbo seem to be missing, but these were not my top priorities list for this phone and I can pretty much live without them. And while now my Mate 10 PRO looks and feels almost as a new phone, EMUI 9 still requires polishing in terms of fluency. Overall, after almost a year of using the phone, I'm still pretty happy about it. Selfie camera could be better, and AI postprocessing could be less aggressive. I can definitely recommend it to those who are looking for a solid phone and don't want to invest a lot into buying current flagship phones. My only concern remains lack of communication from Huawei regarding updates. They actually delivered monthly updates over the year 2018, and now we have received the long promised Pie update. Still they could communicate about the update plan sooo much better than they actually did. ************************************ Oct.16, 2018 - UPDATE: the phone has recently received a handheld night camera mode with an August security patch, and the update with September security patch has just started rolling out. However, still no sign of Face Unlock or GPU Turbo. Probably, we're entirely skipping Android 8.1 and heading directly towards Android 9.0. Besides, I've found a pretty frustrating issue: bluetooth audio quality is rather bad - tried it with multiple bluetooth speakers on two phones. The audio codecs in Android 8 are most likely crippled, and looks like lots of Huawei phones have this issue. We'll see if Android 9.0 can fix this issue. ************************************ Original review below: Before buying Huawei Mate 10 Pro, I read lots of reviews and discussions on forums - it took a while to make a decision and I don't regret it. The phone feels very good in a hand. When you take it, you immediately know it's a business-class phone. Screen, battery life and performance are no doubt top class. Camera is really good, but takes some time to master - some scenes get too much overprocessing with AI. It's not a point and shoot camera, but you can get amazing results with it, especially if you learn the Pro Shooting Mode. I'd totally recommend buying a full screen antiexplosion glass and a good protective case for it, since dropping the phone may result in large damage to screen/back and a very costly repair. The only thing that troubles me a lot (and lots of users on xda, reddit etc.) is lack of insights regarding the software updates. Right now, in July, the US version of the phone is still running April security patch (8.0.0.112) and doesn't have the much awaited FaceUnlock or handheld night camera mode yet - while both features have long been launched across Asia and Europe. No comments or announcements have been done in this regard by Huawei. What's even worse, is that Huawei keeps a full radio silence regarding the further updates - I'm referring exclusively to the US version of the phone now. Recently. they announced transition to a bi-monthly update plan and an upcoming Android 8.1 update featuring GPU Turbo Mode, coming everywhere - but for USA (according to the official sources). It seems like the US version has been abandoned in terms of software updates. Thus I put 4 out of 5 to this phone, unless there is some clear response from HuaweiDeviceUSAService in regards to the software update plans. Will the US version of Mate 10 Pro get the FaceUnlock, handheld night camera mode? Will there be updates to Android 8.1 and to Android P? That we are yet to see in the future.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I just received the Mate 10 Pro today, and I am blown away by its performance. I've put it through hell and the battery has exceeded my expectations. This phone easily has the best battery performance I have ever seen in a cell phone. The camera is great, the screen is bright and has great resolution. The fingerprint sensor is fast, and precise. I love how quickly it responds to touch. The processor is fast, and everything has been running smoothly. I'm using the phone on T-mobile - - no problems at all. Don't believe the negative propaganda. I have used Samsung and Apple phones in the past, and can honestly say that the Mate 10 Pro is a high quality phone equal to (and maybe even surpassing) some of the better known brands. This phone is worth a try!",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I have a lot of Android phones and this one is simply awesome. Coming from a Pixel 2XL on AT&T I took out my sim and put it in the Mate 10 Pro and I find I have VoLTE (like a certified AT&T phone) with excellent signal and voice quality better than any AT&T certified phone I have. The phone has excellent battery life (way better than my Pixel or my Note 8) and is as fast as either of the top flagships. The weight is excellent and it has good feel in the hand, and the vibration motor is also really good for haptic feedback. Display is a really good OLED panel that looks very Samsung tuned (which means viewing angles and color saturation is near perfect). Sound is also real loud and speakers are stereo so it's fun to use. Finally the camera is the best in the Android business with lots of features and excellent color and exposure. Comparatively to the Pixel 2 XL I see some shots on my Mate 10 Pro are better, especially low light, and the selfies are good when you turn off beauty mode. It's has a great portrait mode as well. I would recommend this phone to any iPhone or Android user and could promise a good experience once you tweak it the way you like it. I use Nova Launcher and Textra for SMS and this thing is perfectly customizable all the way through the software system so you can eliminate some of the EMUI aspects of the OS.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"This is my first look at this cool phone. I was in the Market for the Mate 9 about a year ago when I found out that this one will be out soon. The wait is over and I'm not disappointed. Data transfer from my old Samsung Galaxy S6 took a mere 12 minutes, and I had a good 20 GB of Data to transfer. Simply download and install ""Phone clone"" from the App store, load it on both Phones, and you are good to go. (follow the instructions) The performance is stunning, very smooth running, I had all my custom sounds and apps running in no Time. The Camera is simply amazing. It does come with a clear Case, which I did not care for too much, so I purchased one from Tudia, it is much more robust and protective. After 30 or so minutes, I had all my important apps working, set up multiple Email accounts, etc. A little gripe, but not too big of a deal is that it requires the USB C style Cables. Also, it doesn't support wireless charging. A bigger Deal is that it doesn't come with Alexa. The Mate 9 did. Oh, well I'll live. Everyone is raving about the Battery life on this thing, and I have several power hungry apps running at the same time, so we will see about that and I'll report it here. I haven't used the translator yet, but it looks fantastic. The Camera is truly a marvel, shoots pictures on a very high resolution, the Camera actually recognizes what you shoot and therefore picks the right (or sometimes wrong) settings for you. The Fingerprint sensor is ultra fast, I use it to unlock the phone. I know I have only begun to work with this phone, there are many more very cool options to use and I'll report it here as soon as I uncovered some useful tricks. So far I'm impressed, to say the least. 1. Update: Verizon Customers, listen up! (read carefully) QUIT asking if this Phone will work with VERIZON. It will not. EVER! At least read through some older questions before you post yours. Thank you. The End.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Like one of the other reviewer on this site, ""Ancher"", I initially could not get the phone to work. I received my unit yesterday (Feb 20th), and went to AT&T store immediately, they were able to set it up quickly and copy over contact and other info from my old phone. Then I noticed that it has no LTE or 4G signal. The employee at AT&T store was not able to figure out why there is no mobile data network. The phone can receive and make calls, and SMS message also works, but just no internet. After about 1 hour, they gave up, and told me to contact Huawei. That was around 4PM. I went home and contact Huawei right away, the CS agent (her name is Marisa) spend close to 2 hours with me, trying out various stuff, including couple of factory reset, which wipes out stuff I moved over from old phone, still no connection. Wifi works, but just no internet. The option to enable 4G under mobile network menu couldn't be set to enable. They checked the IEMI number, everything seems to check out. In the end, she said to wait 24 hours, maybe it takes a little while for the new SIM card to register. Then I found the review on this site by ""Ancher"". I actually print out his review and took it with me when I visited AT&T store again. They were not sure what to take of that, but to their credit, they were willing to try the method mentioned by ""Ancher"". One of their employee swap my SIM card with his iPhone8's. Both were able to connect to LTE quickly, we played around with some website for a short while, then switched the SIM cards back, and just like I have hoped, my Mate 10 Pro suddenly had no problem with connecting to 4G LTE network. The phone is beautiful, and camera is amazing, but I wish I didn't have to go through this to get it to work. In the end, neither AT&T, nor Huawei was able to fix the problem. It was the power of internet and user community that came through.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"i had a mate 9 and i love the phone it was the best phone i ever had. so i thought i would up grade to the mate 10 pro and i kinda hate it, when you open apps up the screen starts out nice and bright and than it dims to a dull gray drives me crazy.did a google search and people have been complaining about this problem not sure if its software problem or hardware so i know its not me going crazy. its really a shame because i like the phone but the screen is not making me happy.and i did notice that when you have the brightness turned up all the way it does not dim or you just dont notice it. huawei are you fixing the problem?and by the way i hate the 18:9 ratio of new phones now.i might send this one back and try the regular mate 10.and by the way i gave it 2 stars because of the way i see it the screen is a big part of the phone everything else is up to pare edit:this is a little update to my mate10 pro with the above problems with dimming i had other problems with the phone like when someone would call and they had a picture for a id it would be so dim and blurry you could not see it.some times the phone rings sometimes it doesn't same with the text messages.if you kept the phone on 50 percent brightness it was really dark it just seemed like the phone was getting worse.so i returned it and ended up getting another mate 10 pro so instead of getting the 499.00 mocha i got the blue one that cost 548.00.the new phone is working properly and the screen is working fine i did notice on some apps the screen does dim a little like on chrome but you barely notice it.so in the long run i must of got a faulty unit and i hope the new one holds up.i will leave 2 stars because i think huawei knows they have a problem with the phone and hope it can get fixed other people have had this problem.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"This is a great phone. All those mumbo jumbo about spying....I'm pretty sure nsa or some other big bro are reading everything anyway. Now about the phone itself. I rarely experience any lag. I am kind of person that don't really care how a phone look, as long as it has most of the function i needed or wanted, but this phone is so beautiful i actually got a clear case for it. The pictures are amazing i actually can brag about how pretty my pictures are to my friend and family that are using iPhone or Samsung. I can set different apertures, take super fast portrait mode.... One surprising feature, the monochrome lens. Wow I never thought I would like anything in black and white. I hated those black and white movies, but The pictures monochrome lens took was wow, I loved it. I felt like I am one of the super famous photographers that have gallery to show off my work. The AI can recognize different things that are on in front of the camera. Once I took a picture of my street it showed that it's scenery then when I took a picture of the same place during snow. It actually has a small snow flake on the bottom of the screen. When I take a picture of my dog it showed a little doggy on the bittom. The AI can determine what are The best setting, lighting, and other parameters to get The best reault. The battery life is unbelievably long after a while day of work i still have around 70% battery left. Funniest part is started the day with around 94%. It takes about 2hours to fully charge from 30%. Since I had the phone it never went below 30%. I don't game allot, but all The game i have it ran quick and smooth. The resolution of the screen is more than enough for phone this size. All the phones with 4k resolution etc...are way over kill all it does is drain your battery.even at 2k that this phone has is still over kill. Overall The screen is pretty and vibramt. You can also set the screen time to give etc... The emui is not the greatest os skin but with any new toy it can take a bit of learning curve. There are some thing I missed from my nexus6. I love the large favorite tiles from the Google phone app.but mostly just minor things, over time I will get adopt to it and who knows might even like the way huawei has it. Now the bad... IT DOESN'T HAS ANY HEADPHONE JACK..... I usually have 2sets of headphone when I am at work, a Bluetooth and a 3.5mm. It's so annoying when my Bluetooth headphone ran out of battery now because my good headphone is not compatible. I have to use the crappy ones that came with it. If you don't like the themes, you can always dl nova launcher and other launcher to cover it. S8s9+ they are just too dang tall. I tried it just felt kinda awkward. They are basically the same damn phone, s9 has a better camera. Samsung need the step up. Sorry to bash on samsung, I had their first generation note. i used it for a few years never really like it, too Kathy and buggy. They overpriced their phone just like Apple does. I got this phone for only 650.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Amazing phone. Takes great pictures. I am the only person that gets signal out at my friends country house. FAST FAST FAST.

B078T2T2FL,"There is no denying that the Mate 10 Pro is a beautifully crafted powerhouse worthy of taking on any competitor flagship device. The build is decidedly premium and the device is chocked full of features. EMUI is definitely an acquired taste but, after using it for some time, I found myself liking it - that being said, it's about as far away from stock android as you can get. The deal breaker for me - and the reason I actually got rid of this device - was the complete and utter lack of any updates for the US variant of this device. The US variant was excluded from the turbo GPU rollout and, at the time I got rid of my device in late August, it was STILL running on the April (yes, that's April) security patch. Unfortunately Huawei has essentially abandoned its US customer base and, given the circumstances, I can't entirely blame them. It's a real shame too because this is truly a spectacular device, but the lack of post-purchase support and updates is really inexcusable for any flagship device. That being said, if software updates and timely security patches are not essential for you, this device is worth considering. Unfortunately, for me, all the great aspects of this device were not enough for me to look past using a flagship device running with nearly 6 month old security patch.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"DONOT BUY THIS !! UPDATE 10/21: I got a CHINESE DEVICE and customer support told me to get in touch with team in China .. as this device is made to work in China and not US: ******* Katy 17:18 Thank you.

B078T2T2FL,"Long worth, definitely, I had never used a phone from China before, I was worried about whether it would be good or not, today I just got it and it's awesome!!!! before I ordered it my Dad was like: James it's 800 bucks, you can buy a I8 are you sure you want to buy a phone from China instead? but it went out pretty well and I totally love it!!!",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,I switched over from Samsung and have not regret it I have owned the mate 2 mate 8 mate9 and now the mate 10 Pro and have not been disappointed at all I get a lot of the same features and the phone is capable of doing basically the same as Samsung Galaxy I'm enjoying all the features and the speed that this phone has and the battery life is outstanding way better than Samsung.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I never thought I would stray from the Samsung Galaxy line of phones, but Huawei made me do it. This is my first device by them after randomly coming across this phone on Amazon. Everything you've read about this phone is accurate. The fingerprint reader is lighting fast and accurate. The camera is superb. The battery is out of this world. They took everything great from Apple and Samsung and made a better product in the end. A lot of reviews talk about how heavily skinned the os is, mainly because of how it comes with the option to not have an app drawer.... but my Galaxy s7 had the same feature. I even like the health app better from Huawei. Seeing my steps right on the lockscreen is just another neat feature. I bought a case from mine because I drop my phone more than the average user, but for everyone else it comes with a light rubber case, and a screen protector preinstalled. You won't regret this purchase. Buy it",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I was skeptical about this product working in the US. It has been two weeks. I have T-Mobile as my carrier. Calls are clear and wifi calling works as well. Pictures are vivid and colorful and the phone comes with a lot of features. Model is as comparable to other flagships. Sound for media is good but not best, yet not lower than other popular models. I have always used Samsung flagships and my wife uses Moto Force 2. Overall, for the price and the features of this phone, it is a Good Buy.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I saw the adverts: AI, FAST, BIG SCREEN, 128GB. What they don't tell you is: NO 3.5MM JACK BUILT IN (you have to carry around this awkward dongle to use 3.5mm jack), no adding an SD card of any kind, no dual sim support. Even more spyware: google sucking up your passwords and sending it to ""building 8"" in china. Only reason I got another huawei was because my honor x6 was $150 and worked like a champ, this thing's $544+ and works the same, just internet capabilities are slightly faster, but to lose all those options: no SD, no 3.5mm jack, even more privacy r/ape, no thanks, they either give me my money back or I'll charge it back IDGAF!",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I'm upgrading to this from an LG g6. I never upgraded this fast after a phone purchase, but this phone just had so much more that I wanted battery, wired TV connection, more ram, ir blaster etc. I never really consider astetics when buying a phone but I am often blown away by how pretty this phone is, not only just the outside but even something as simple as the Dialer looks great. In reading Some of the other reviews I noticed people missing alerts From Certain things, I noticed this as well but I figured it out. The phone tries to save battery in doing so it limits background activity, if you have an app you want to see those alerts from go to settings>battery>Launch here switch the apps you want alerts from to Manual and enable everything. I did this with my text automator app and alarm clock apps to get them working. Some have enough faulted emui for its complexity but I enjoy being able to have control over every aspect of my phone performance. Update: charging performance on this phone is beyond anything I've ever had before I've had phones with Quick Charge 3 they do not compare at all. Even after a 14 hr work day using the phone extensively I only get down to 30% at most... My commute home is 30 mins and my phone is fully charged when I arrive ( I have an inverter in my car so I can use the huawei supercharger) . I cap it off again before I leave for work the next day while I'm getting dressed, this is the first phone I will never have to leave on the charger all night as I sleep.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I wanted to like the phone but after going thru a couple of phone that we not supposed to be done by Amazon with US warranty, I ended up receiving a US model with a pretty bad camera. Judi customer service is useless and they cannot resolve any issues so save your time and avoid using at all cost. The phone itself is very good quality with nice night screen. You will not be able to upgrade to the August Android security patch until the Huawei server decided to do so. The US updated are way behind everyone else in the world and Huawei has pretty much forgot about North American market due to ongoing issues with the government. You cannot unlock the bootloader either which pretty much leaves you at the mercy of official updated. So a bad camera and no updates just didn't cut it for me and especially at the price point of $600. Had to turn the phone and get a different brand.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"By far the best phone I have ever had the pleasure of using. The Mate 10 Pro is everything I was looking for in a phone, it is large, has a lightning fast processor, amazing dual camera, nice and quick fingerprint scanner, very good on board sound quality which switches between mono and stereo sound as you rotate the phone between landscape and portrait, and so much more! Also something to note, I have no quarrels at all with EMUI! I have read reviews that knock it but I cannot understand why, I quite enjoy it. !!! Important Note !!! This phone does not have a 3.5mm audio jack! This is not an issue at all for me because it comes with an adaptor for the lovely usb type c charging port so you can still use 3.5mm audio devices, it comes with a pair of earbuds that have actually quite good sound quality as well. I am absolutely overjoyed with this phone, and don't worry about charging it! This phone lasts me at least three days using it prety frequently for games like hearthstone and constantly reading books.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I already owned a Huawei tablet so I knew how good their quality was. When my less than a year old G8 phone overheated over night and the screen looked like it took LSD, I decided to get this phone. The only negative is it has no wireless charging which is ridiculous for a pro phone. However it has double the internal storage of the G8 and 2 more gb of memory. I was surprised that it came with a basic gel case and a screen protector already on it. Nice but I will still get a different case. Aa little surprised it has no microSD slot but again it has 128gb of storage so not really needed especially in the world of cloud storage. *Update* While this phone is still the best I have ever had, I have come to discover it is not compatible with my Fitbit Vera as far as syncing the clock/apps/faces via wifi. This is not to say that it won't discover and pair via bluetooth. But to setup a fitbit from start you need wifi. Thankfully it was already setup via a previous phone so it is still usable as long as I do not want to change any settings. (which I would have to do with the previous phone now)",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"This is the best smartphone I've ever owned. I did a ton of research before purchasing and I'm very happy with my decision. No problems whatsoever. I've been on the same battery charge for 2 days and still have 60% left, madness.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Quite happy with this phone! So nice to have a top end phone here in the US that doesn't fit what the masses have with the Samsung or Apple options. Using this phone on AT&T and works wonderful with 4gLTE. The camera is outstanding and is easy to take beautiful photos with. The phone has been extremely fast running games, movies, general apps etc. No crashes, slow down, etc. Have had zero issues with call quality- has sounded clear on both ends of the call. For the size, the phone feels pretty light as well. Coming from a smaller Xperia Z3 I was a little worried how the slightly larger phone would feel- no regrets! The screen is beautiful as well. Some reviews on other sites noted it has a slightly lower resolution than some alternate options- frankly unless you are running image tests, you wont notice in day to day use. It's a beautiful screen. Sound quality is a step up from my old Xperia as well. Overall, very thrilled with this offering from Huawei. I also have the Huawei Classic Watch 2 paired with this- perfect combo and is working great. Do your research about the tech on this phone, it's top notch. The US is getting this one a little later than the international community but it's good to know it has been a hit in many countries outside of the US. Really solid option for US consumers if you are looking for an alternate to the big 2 here. A note on car chargers and extra wall chargers- if you want to keep the extremely fast charging this phone is capable of, be sure to look for 5A charging capable cables and devices. Many of the other devices use 2A or 3A charging which doesn't provide the power this device needs for its quick charge abilities. Couple examples from items I ordered that are working well: Dual USB Car Charger Super Charge 5A USB Type C Charging Cable and USB Type C Nylon Braided Super Fast Charging Cord(5A) Standard usb c cables and chargers should work but wont get you the super charge capabilities.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Amazing Android phone, smooth, easy to use, fair price, really a battery monster. I'm a long time iPhone user, after Apple is reported to slow down the old iPhones deliberately including iPhone 7, even my iPhone 7+ is released just one year ago, I decided to change to Android. This phone is smoother than my iPhone 7 plus, and it doesn't go dead in low temperature. Google finally made the Android OS competitive in almost all levels.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"The software is defective as I couldn't sign in with my google account because it keeps telling me to use one of the owners' account to sign in, however, this is a brand new phone. I tried skipped through this and data transfer and finger print unlock then it takes me back to page 1, which is the language selection. This was an endless cycle and the technical support said I might have received a defective phone. Also, the charger (usb-c) is completely missing from the package, the USB adapter is sealed but dirt and it says LG electronics on it? I wonder if this was a returned item from someone else though the phone looks completely brand new, untouched, and free of any finger prints. After reading more reviews and the software update issues mentioned by multiple people, I am not going to place another order. Who knows if Huawei would give up the US market amid the tension with US. Other than the issues mentioned above, I think it's got a very slick design and the screen is very clear and sharp.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I bought this phone as a replacement for my Nexus 6P, but after a month of using it I am not sure it matches the quality of that previous phone, which I loved. The phone frequently tells me I have no signal (in the middle of Boston) and struggles to load pages on the subway or around town even when the signal bars show as full. Instagram has crashed several times, a text I sent to a group went to one individual only (she showed me on her phone that it only went to her even though my phone made it look like it went to the group) and all my text messages with my boyfriend, which had been imported from the Nexus 6P, were just gone one day. I also don't love all the Huawei apps that are installed as alternatives to Google apps, and had to figure out how to disable them all to avoid getting two sets out notifications all the time. The headphones are like airplane ones, hard plastic that won't stay put in your ears, and which are super uncomfortable. They were 'free' with the phone though, so I'm not complaining about that too much. The free case and headphone jack converter were nice. The camera is good and I do value the fact that the phone is water resistant and has eye comfort mode. Generally it does what I need it to do but I am sort of wishing I'd bought something else....is it possible to return I wonder?",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"It's sad that this phone won't get the exposure it deserves, because it really is a great phone. For starters, the battery life is incredible. With heavy use (games like Hearthstone and lots of YouTube) I can easily come out the other side of my 12 hour shift with 15-20% left. If you do have to charge it though, the supplied charger puts out 4.5A @ 5V and will get you several more hours of use in no time flat. The fingerprint sensor is something else that is unbelievably fast. Almost the instant you touch the well placed sensor the phone is unlocked. I loved how fast the sensor is on my Nexus 6P which is also a Huawei built phone, but this one is in a whole other ballpark as far as speed is concerned. Another thing I like about it is the stereo speakers. I loved the ones in my 6P and was hugely disappointed in the sad, lone speaker Google put on my Pixel XL. This phone uses the single bottom firing speaker while in portrait mode but uses both when in landscape and is more than adequate for showing your co-workers the latest video you found of Panda bears falling over and over again. The camera is another area that Huawei made sure was done right. Pictures turn out great with no effort and only get better with all the options they give you. Same goes for videos, there are a total of 9 different modes of video that go from tiny MMS size videos to 4k @ 30 fps, along with 1080p @ 60 & 120 fps, and 720p @ 240 fps. Now that I've brought up the Pixel XL that I attempted to replace my 6P with I want to say something about how these phones feel in your hand. The 6P and the Mate 10 Pro both feel as expensive as they are. The Pixel XL feels like the cheap plastic toys you get with the tickets at Chuck E Cheese. It's a minor point to most I'm sure but if I'm spending $800+ on a phone I want to feel like my money is well spent. As for the things I don't like. My main gripe is the display. Yes, under most circumstances it's a great screen even though the resolution isn't as high as other flagship phones. There are really only a few instances where its lower resolution shows itself, and the main one where I notice it is in the game Hearthstone. When your cards are low in your hand the card art is pretty distorted looking. When you bring them up to take a closer look they are much better looking. On the 6P and Pixel XL the card art is nice and sharp all the time. The other complaint I have is of course the lack of a headphone jack. We've all got our own opinions and I'm on the side that misses it. If Samsung can make an IP68 rated phone with a headphone jack then Huawei should be able to as well. But of course them and Google are too busy worrying about what Apple is doing. We don't need thinner phones that make it easier to bend/break these expensive phones, and I'd much rather have the jack than the IR blaster they included.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"This phone is absolutely amazing for the price. It's an even better deal now that it's down to $550 (purchased when it was $650). I have been using it daily for a few months now- it is replacing my Huawei Nexus 6P. Setup: It was almost a seamless setup for me...Almost. I ran into issues in regards to the Huawei data transfer app. It would not connect at all, so I went with another app and it went smooth as butter Performance and battery life: I have not noticed any issues with performance. I do not play games much using this phone, but I use google, youtube, messaging, and media apps a lot. Apps are snappy upon loading, fingerprint is immediate upon touch(almost too sensitive if that's possible). No strange bugs yet or crashes/freezes. Charging is insanely fast...faster than you'll ever really need especially if you leave it overnight - it'll finish probably within an hour. More recently I've decided to try out Apple Music which surprisingly does not drain the battery life on this. I can get through two days easily with no charging. I have seen many days where I have music playing almost the whole day, watching videos occasionally and finding myself with enough battery life for the next day. Quirks: -The knuckle screenshot is a bit useless to me. Half the time it works, half the time it doesn't. One time - the knuckle screenshot activated upon using my regular fingertips. I was just scrolling! Will disable if possible -You cannot disable certain Huawei Apps...This is absolutely annoying. If you root the phone, you may be able to mess around, but I plan on keeping this stock. The issue that I came across was when I used Apple Music over bluetooth. Upon enabling and connecting bluetooth, Huawei's Music App started playing instead of Apple Music. I cannot disable Huawei's Music App or make Apple Music the default App.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I bought the phone after my Google Pixel XL took a dunk in the sea water and lost its life. I did some extensive research before I settled for the best Huawei phone at the time. I am really picky about camera, Pixel 2 XL was my first choice but didn't buy one because of high price tag and so so battery life. The Huawei phone has great size in hand: not as wide as Pixel XL, easier to handle with one hand. The screen size is reasonably good. Although it doesn't have the pixel density as Pixel XL, I was not able to tell the difference during day to day use. Camera: not as good as the Pixel XL in terms of color vibrancy (Huawei Mate 10 pro photos tend to have more contrast than my liking during high contrast situation), but low light photo is probably a little better due to image stabilization. It's max zoom photo is sharper than Pixel. But those are the extreme situation we are talking about. In those situation, Huawei has a Black and White camera that does a decent job capturing the image. Software: Unlike some polarizing review about Huawei's operating system, I find Huawei's effort is mostly unobtrusive. The Safe App is a nice touch, but you do loose the full size backup of photos and first in line update Google offered to Pixel phones. Battery life: OMG, this is where this phone shines. When I am using the Pixel (small one) my battery was at 15% around 6pm; when I was using the Pixel XL, my battery was at 15% around 9pm; while using the Mate 10 Pro, my battery was at 50% around 11pm. The phone saved my day a few times when I was traveling in China, snatching 600 photos at History Museum of Shaanxi and Terra Cotta Museum. Irregularities: Back in my days with Samsung and Google phones, I would encounter about one unexpected shut-down and re-start. My limited experience with Huawei has no such issue (only four months though). Overall experience: I use the phone to take pictures, check email, listen to music and watch videos. I do a lot of internet surfing and play very little video games (my son do use it to play games). For what I do with the phone, it runs flawlessly. Now only if it can process the photo like Google Pixel. It is a very nice phone at a very good price.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Exceptional build quality and camera! Fell way short on Android Auto integration. Known problem but, Huawei is yet to release a patch or fix. Tech support confirmed it and in not so many words, told me to return it and get another brand. Pretty irresponsible for the world's 2nd largest producer of cell phones. The proprietary EMUI is not the best at this price point--should have kept it pure Android,",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Update 5/5/2019: This phone has been super reliable and has been updated to Android Pie with up to the April 2019 Security updates so good job Huawei for keeping up with Google's updates! Also, I grew a little tired of the ugly layout of EMUI so I am using Nova Launcher and everything has a perfect layout now! This phone is cheaper than when I bought it, so don't hesitate to get this device. Mine is still super fast! Also, check out some attached camera samples and the Nova Launcher layout. This phone is great! I bought it on sale as a second phone while I ship my Samsung Galaxy S8+ off to be fixed. I initially wanted something cheap and basic, but I was continually drawn to this. I'm so glad I didn't settle for a $100 Nokia or Motorola. This phone has a screen just a notch below my Samsung, better speakers, a better in hand feel and some other spec improvements! As a phone on sale for $550, I don't think there is a better option out there. It makes me have buyer's remorse for getting locked into a contract with a $850 Samsung that I'm not in love with anymore. Get this phone while it's on sale, I'm not sure it is worth the original MSRP of $800 due to a lack of wireless charging, quad HD, and expandable memory. Still a great phone!",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I love my phone it is amazing what I dont love is the price war over colors because what is the first thing you do when you get a glass phone? You put a cover on it for protection. Check this out, If you buy Diamond black it is $797.61 or midnight blue is$ 689.89 then the mocha brown is $389.00 and grey is $6.92.99 What is wrong with people paying double or triple for a color. I did some research and the black is a porsche design. but the others are all exactly the same. Ok another issue I had was I got the first phone from Maxproductsales next day 2nd day shipping. and had to send it back it was super hot when you plugged it in and you could not hear me when I talked on it, and the phone would cut in and out. So I sent it back and got the huawie p 30 lite from Purple Passion and as soon as I opened the box and picked up the phone I put it right back in and it went back to UPS in 13 minutes It was plastic and I did not like it at all so I reordered the HUAWEI mate 10 PRO and Made sure I got it from a different seller THE Tech GROUP It came with a charge and I went right to you tube and watched all the tricks and things the phone could do and I am still learning. BUT WARNING, my first phone was the Huawei mate se and I loved it so much but it fell onto the black payment and cracked so bad it is now useless. so I brought it to be fixed and it costs 350.00 to fix it and if you go to ebay or here amazon it is brand new for under 160.00. but let me tell you it is absolutely worth every penny. the only reason I did not get the same one is because I thought I was going to have this one fixed and have a spare phone and also I never ever get anything for myself I always do for someone else and this time I said it is time for me to get something nice. But it did take me two weeks to hit the pay button I can get things for others but when it comes to me I have a hard time spending the money. but this money was well spent and I would get it again. I Did. Enjoy",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Fantastic phone with many features, great camera my 1st non apple phone and am so satisfied with it. I waited for 3 months to get it since AT&T dropped the ball on carrying it, bought from Amazon and the wait was well worth it, I strongly recommend this phone to all my associates.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"This is a terrific phone. I go to Hong Kong for work and this was the top of the line smartphone just under 2 years ago. I always wanted one but refused to pay $850 for it. I saw it on sale from a dealer on Amazon about 3 months ago for just $479 plus 3 months Mintmobile sim card. I switched from T-Mobile to Mintmobile which is still T-Mobile at a fraction of the cost. I love this phone. It's got everything. The AI is great. Leica camera is one of the best ever. Huawei is probably the best cellphone manufacturer in the world. Their quality and specs beat Apple and Samsung. Too bad the trade war with China doesn't allow Google to associate with Huawei anymore. Hopefully it will be changed and they can continue their relationship and provide updates and OS improvements. I still recommend these phones although, now that the ties with Google have been severed, you may want to put off purchasing a Huawei product.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I've been waiting for this to release in the US! Works great, excellent battery life. Fast charging. I wish it had wireless charging but I look forward to that on the next model.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"This is my first Huawei and it is nothing but Awesome. The battery life is remarkable. The phone has so many features and is so customizable I think it would take me about four days to cover the ones I know about. Durable phone as well. The only thing that could be considered a down side is there is no place for a micro SD card on this model. There are some that have dual sim or single sim and micro SD, but this one does not.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I completely regret switching from a $299 Moto X4 to the ""flagship"" Mate 10 Pro, this was my first and last Huawei device. Here's some of the quirks I've dealt with: Camera - Each time you open the camera app, you will be spammed with the message: ""Wide aperture adds bokeh effects to your photos to emphasize the subject."" The message takes up a quarter of the screen and you need to either tap the screen or take a dummy picture before taking your real picture for the message to go away (until you open the camera app again.) - One day you'll be spammed with the message ""sharpening photo, do not move your phone"" (after every single picture), next day the messages go away completely. Miscellaneous - You will not get 3rd party notifications on the always on display, my last 3 phones (even budget ones) supported this feature - I decided to turn off always on display since lock screen notifications worked, that is until they didn't. Gmail notifications stopped appearing on my lock screen even though everything was enabled, then 3 days later it started working again. - The battery management is so aggressive on this phone that I think it affected my SMS notifications. One day a friend sent me an important SMS message which I never received a notification for, he eventually messaged me over google hangouts which I received. I then opened up SMS and then suddenly the notification finally popped up. I went to Settings -> Battery -> Launch and realized SMS was set to ""manage automatically"" (default for all apps) while hangouts was set to ""manage manually"" which is why I think alerts work fine hangouts but sometimes not for SMS. - Huawei doesn't support the popular quick charge standard, so 3rd party QC wall chargers or QC power banks will not fast charge this phone, you'll need to buy official huawei fast charger. I ended up factory resetting the phone but the issues resurfaced shortly thereafter. Figured I got a lemon so Amazon sent me a replacement, same exact issues on the 2nd one. These issues may have been resolved in a software update but Huawei is not supporting the US model with updates. For perspective, my phone is on April security update and very old firmware .112 (international versions are on .150), so we're missing out on features like face unlock and possible fixes to my complaints above. I will be returning this phone to Amazon.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"This phone is a beast. Amazing battery life, can easily go two days moderate use without charging, gorgeous display. Camera produces great photos although at full size you can see overprocessing. Calls are clear. Wifi good. Gps blazing fast. And with the usa unlocked version you have full control over every aspect including what keeps running in the background unlike stock android devices. Only negative is the abysmally dim LED notification light which is impossible to see outdoors. Nevertheless still highly recommended despite that.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,This phone is outstanding I can use it for 3d gaming. Screen casting to the smart tv via WiFi. It charges fast about 50% in 30 minutes. The battery last a whole day of 805 work with moderate use. I usually come home with 70-80% battery left! Also no lag. everything happens instantly. I also use the figerprint scanner to instantly log into secure websites and the phone itself. Fingerprint scanner is instant. The phone clone app it comes with allowed me to transport all my settings an apps from my old Galaxy phone with no problems. Overall outstanding. I upgrade from an 3 year old phone so I am highly amazed!,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"This is, honestly, the best phone I've ever used. I bought it for the camera as I like to take pictures everywhere I go and it's not always practical to lug a DSLR around. What interested me initially was the Leica dual lens camera with F/1.6 aperture and 20/12 megapixel resolution. It has all kinds of ""smart"" modes but what I found most useful was the pro mode that allows for exposure, film speed and other adjustments as well as offering an actual manual focus in addition to the auto. The camera is amazing and probably overkill for most people, I still find l little things I can do with it every time I snap a new photo. On paper, the Mate10pro has everything I could ever ask for in a phone and more than some high end tablets and computers (Including the one I owned at the time). 6gb RAM and 128gb memory with a 2160x1080 display are pretty impressive and I find myself using the phone more and more in applications usually better left to a computer such as drawing and photo editing. I go to the mate10 when editing my business page in Facebook far more often than my computer. That being said, I still hesitated about purchasing it due to the pervasive anti-Chinese tech sentiment and their generalized reputation for poor quality- if the charging port in my Samsung S5 hadn't finally stopped working I might still be debating the purchase right now. I pulled the trigger finally and I can say without reservation that I haven't made a better aquistion in my life. Fit and finish are as good as I've ever seen, and the battery life is phenomenal. Using the supplied charger I can get full charge in an a couple hours and it easily lasts through a normal 12 hour shift at work. Even running multiple apps (Facebook, Adobe Sketch) I can count on 4-6 hours before I have to look for an outlet. I bought it this spring and it's proven itself well worth the purchase price ($612 and change for the phone, Spurion case, next day shipping and tax). I've bought a few value minded tech purchases from Chinese companies before and have come to expect a certain trade-off between expectation and price point but I'm left wanting nothing in this particular instance. I'm not a hardcore techie and I doubt that I've really pushed this little machine to it's limits but I'm very impressed and extremely happy with the product I received from Amazon. Oh, one thing I didn't like and still bothers me a bit is not being able to change font style. I can change the size but can't personalize it.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"So I will start this by saying that I have always had a galaxy phone starting with the S5. Loved it still my favorite smartphone just wish it would not have gone to a glass sandwich went to the S7 years later when my S5. Began to show it's age now it began to do the same I now normally I would have been ok I am going to get the S9. Well at work we use Huawei switches, routers, and APs and our contact for Huawei. Let us play with his Honor 7 loved the device I began shopping around and found this for just ease $200 less than a S9 and more power. I have had this phone for a week now and I can say I love this phone the build quality is amazing it is so impressive what it can do and at the price. Definitely worth the money and recommend this phone to people looking for a new Android smartphone.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"If you want a phone with big screen, long battery life and excellent camera, you will not regret with this one. However, Mate10 Pro has much more new features(from update) in China version. US version is abandoned by American Huawei . No facial recognition, GPU turbo or new camera mode will be updated. It is a shame that this flagship phone is kept from excellence by its after service. ------------------------------------ 8/7 update -add night shot mode and android Jul security update But, this update break night shot mode and light trial. ------------------------------------ 8/14 update -night shot mode fixed I hope to get face recognition and GT as soon as possible. ------------------------------------ 9/4 still no clue of update of GPUturbo or face recognition.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"My previous phone was the moto z play and I feel this was a nice jump. -Fantastic battery life, I usually get 7-9 hours of screen on time if I'm using it a lot in 1 day. Otherwise it'll last for atleast 2-3 days easy. -It charges super quick with the included charger. -No headphone jack but there is a included adapter and a pair of headphones. -Accessories aren't as abundant as they would be for a Galaxy phone or iPhone. - the camera is pretty good. Most shots look great! - Huawei's skin is mostly good. - no microSD slot but you're getting 128gb internal storage out of the box. - No wireless charging. If you really care about that. -The speakers work alright. If you're looking for something different then your typical brands I'd recommend it.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I was excited to get the Huawei Mate 10 because I loved the 9 so much. However, I quickly realized they modified things on the 10 in order to make it more proprietary. Otherwise, there isn't much difference. The phone is quick but there is no longer an aux port for headphones. Headphones must use the USB-C port and be compatible. I started having trouble with the camera quality as well. The rear-facing camera takes very beautiful quality pictures. However, the front-facing camera was warped and make pictures look distorted. Almost like you're looking through a fishbowl. There were minimally different features such as the ""Translate"" app and the ""full-screen mode"" for apps. I switched back to the Huawei Mate 9 because i found the 10 to be of lower quality overall. If you have a 9, I recommend staying with it or upgrading to a Samsung Galaxy S9.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I upgraded from the honor 8 to the mate pro 10. I've always like Huawei phones, reliable and fast. The performance does not downgrade over time. EMUI interface isn't bad (can be changed). Camera is unreal, takes fantastic photos. Has AI built into the camera (ex: taking a picture of sunset, camera recognizes this and shows you a small picture of a sunset and adjusts for best lighting... Same goes for a person, dog, etc). I downloaded fortnite to test out the graphics and I have to say they are better than my Xbox one. No lag, great performance all around. Phone comes with headphones, headphone adapter for type c, case, built in screen protector and quick charger (phone charges to 100% in under an hour). Battery life lasts me a full day and a half before I need to charge.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,The phone has by far the worst speaker. There are lots of noise in the bottom speaker when the volume is above half the max. The noise is especially bad if it's music and bass heavy.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"After years of Samsung Galaxy phones, I made the switch and it's awesome! Things that I love: 1. It came ready with a screen protector already applied. This saved me money and so much hassle! 2. Customizing my phone and app settings is so much easier and intuitive, so the phone feels more like an extension of me rather than a display phone with a few of my stickers on it. 3. Set up was super smooth, quick and simple. Once the new SIM card was in, it was ready to use. Battery was only at 50%, but it charges really fast. 4. A set of headphones (decent sound quality) ending with a male usb c (instead of 3.5mm jack) is included, but they also included an adapter for your favorite 3.5mm headphones. I found that very thoughtful. 5. No bloatware! Even un-carrier phones would have a ton of pre-installed software in addition to the Android stuff, but this one has *very* few additions and they're easy to uninstall or disable. The only reason I give this 4.5/5 is that there's no option to expand capacity with a micro (or nano) SD card. I know that's a feature available in the mate 20 pro, but I wish this phone had it. Fortunately, the 128GB capacity should last a long time.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"After few months usage. I love this phone so much. First, It's battery life is excellent. Two to three days without charging is not a problem (l'm not a cell phone minion). It's screen is sharp and the color is vivid. You can read the screen easily even under strong sunlight. But the software has a problem. When I watch YouTube, something the video become choking. After l run a cleanup program, the problem solved. I will give this phone 5 star if the software has no problem.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I just wish I've switched to Huawei Mate 10 Pro earlier. Performance, AI technology, quality build, HDR10 support, 4000mhA battery that optimized by AI so by the end of the day your battery is at 90+%, Leica professional camera, KIRIN 970 processor with AI that is constantly optimized based on your usage, 128 GB internal memory, 6GB RAM, super fast charging (30 min = 60%), EMUI 8.0 skin features on top of Android 8.0, instant desktop mode without docking station just need $20 USB C to HDMI cable, beautiful design, stereo speakers, price < $600, the list of pros just goes on and on. If this is not a perfect flagship phone, then I don't know what is the definition of a perfect phone anymore. Do yourself a favor, YouTube Huawei Mate 10 Pro features, tips and tricks, understand all of the them, then just buy it, you'll understand why this phone was blocked from making a splash on US market. It would've created tsunami effect :-).",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,The respose time is super fast! High resolution screen. Leica camera is perfect! The charge time is very short. Waiting for another deal,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"First time to have a Huawei phone. It looks good and functions well as a flagship phone. The $150 gift card for pre-order makes it cost-effective. The phone comes with a protective case, which is ok. Since I want to have more protection for the screen, I also purchased the Smart View Flip Case made by Huawei, which looks great and works well.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"For the moment it's a great phone. It looks very elegant and beautiful, it's fast and it has a lot of internal memory which it's great. It has some issues with Bluetooth, sometimes it doesn't pair as quick and easy as I expected. Apart from that, is a great phone. I will try to update later",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"The build quality is pretty darn great. I really like the hardware, including the fingerprint sensor, etc. What I don't like? The OS (or, OS overlay). Emui really slows down the phone. Maybe it's just too different than the mostly-stock Android I've been using on my Moto G phones (since generation 2). I dunno .. I find it beautiful, and it seems to have a lot of features, but .. something's lacking. I'm going to return the phone.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Me gustó el me llegó a tiempo y sellado con su plástico y llegó bien. Me gusta la cámara y la pantalla va fluido y puedo compartir mi pantalla del célula en la tv LG también da internet a mi tableta ..lo que un iPhone 6,7,8,no pueden de manera fácil o nada por el precio este es terminal está exelente.!!! Gracias al vendedor por ser verídico en la transacción 100% recomendado original no complain.:)",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I like it and the delivery was perfect on the time, but actually i have few problems with cellphone because sometimes the camera has shadows. The shadows are in some cases, not all the time, so is tolerable. Other thing is that sometimes the cellphone restarts by it self but just few times too. I hope dont have more inconvenients cause i wouldn't like to claim de garantie. Then the rest, everything is ok. Its a very nice smartphone! I love it!",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Disappointed with the look of the front screen, It looks just like the galaxy note 5 I had a few years ago. The screen size is NOT 6"" ask they announce at amazon, it is actually smaller than the Samsung galaxy S9 Plus. Comparing the front screen on both made me cry. Another feature on Samsung for 2 generations now is FACE and IRIS recognition. Not on Huawei either. Only pattern, password, pin and their grates is fingerprint and is in the back of the phone. Oh, another huge feature missing is charging wireless. has been on Samsung since the Gaalaxy 5, Way behind. The speed is good, memory, wifi etc. Can't complain.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I've had this phone for 8 months and I have absolutely loved it. Its a fantastic device with crazy battery life and that really supports my needs of the phone. Supercharging has been great up until recently when it stopped working entirely. The phone doesn't charge most of the time. It is very finicky and will just randomly stop charging overnight, unprovoked. I have 2 OEM chargers cords and bricks. I use no other chargers. The connection of the charger is not the problem. I have cleaned the port and the chargers thoroughly to no avail. Really disappointed and want this resolved.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I bought this phone few weeks ago after using the mate SE and I like it, so far so good. The only problem I have is with the software google map in particular. Any type I open google map it freezes and won't respond. The only thing that works is home button, back does nothing and it won't give you access to type address or anything. It just stays open like a wallpaper and nothing will respond till you hit home button. If anyone has a solution to this problem I'll really appreciate it. Thank you",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I purchased this phone in 02/18, when purchased it said Duel sim phone. I tried to put a second sim in phone and didn’t work. Huawei customer service has informed me that you cant have a dual sim phone in the US and the second sim is disabled. Amazon will not refund my purchases. When purchased it clearly said dual sim phone. I still love the phone Best ever but very misleading.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I change from iphone 6 plus to mate 10 pro, and find out that mate 10 pro is much better. The camera is intelligent, which take terrific selfies, and response time is fast. Unlock is like immediate, much faster than iphone. Do not have to endure endless update from iOS, which make iphone slower and slower.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Amazing camera, battery.came with a case and a screen protector. Super snappy and water proof . There's really not a negative besides no headphone jack",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,Love it but you definitely have to do research to get the most out of this phone. I bought it for the camera but I'm loving the overall performance. If you're looking for a phone with a top 3 camera performance on the market and a snappy processor for under $600. Buy this phone!!,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Was looking at much more expensive devices and happened to catch this Mate 10 Pro on Amazon for $426. New phone that exceeds my expectations.for an outstanding price. Call quality, display, battery life, cameras and sound are excellent. Thanks Amazon... Just an update. I have really enjoyed this device. It is getting consistently 8+ hours of screen on time and usually lasts a couple of days on charge. I am getting used to the EMUI software although I would prefer a more stock Android interface. But all my apps work well, apps are fast and fluid, call and network quality are better than my OnePlus, and the little extras you get with EMUI makes the phone more productive. Camera functions are extensive and fun to experiment. And Huawei has by far the best packaging and freebies in the phone game. Includes a nice set of powered ear buds, pre-installed screen protector, clear case, super charger and beautiful box. Overall a great value.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"This phone is a flagship performer. Very nice build quality and materials. The AI processing seems gimmicky at the moment but it's promising of what it can do in the future. like: sharp and bright screen, fast fingerprint reader, fast UI, good camera app, all day battery dislike: no 3.5 jack, no sd card, too much noise reduction in photos (waxy look)",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,The phone is very snappy. It's suprisingly thin. Battery life is its greatest strength. Takes superb photos especially in portait mode. Overall a great budget phone.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Man this phone screams. It was worth every last dime. Hauwei is killing the competition and the Hauwei P20 that debuted after this one, it's specs are even more awesome than my Mate 10 Pro. Hauwei don't hurt them like that. Apple who? Samsung who? Crushing the competition. #Yessir",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,I have been in tech my entire career and I am very aware of 'how things work'. It is very intuative. The battery is fantastic. It has a great asthetic look to it. The camera is stunning. I would do everything in my power if I were Apple to keep this phone out of the US market. It is an iPhone destroyer.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I've had my Mate 10 Pro Over a year now It's proven to be much better than I had hoped. The phone has a large screen, is fast, looks good, doesn't mysteriously reboot randomly (like the one I won't name), no compatibility issues (which surprised me considering it's running EMUI) and has 128gb onboard storage (which is plenty for me). The fingerprint sensor on the back works extremely well and allows you the ability to unlock the phone via this avenue (so no more needing to press the power button to turn on the screen before scanning your fingerprint). The phone comes with a case and screen protector, so it's instantly usable as a normal device out of the box . The only downside I've found, is also tied to one of this phone's positive, in that the screen protector which comes pre-installed on the screen of the phone isn't that great. It'll give you some limited protection, but nothing like a tempered glass protector would. Overall, it's my only complaint and if you consider that this comes with the phone at no extra cost, isn't that much of a drawback. There's also the fact that the Mate 10 Pro doesn't have a microSD slot, which you may also need to consider. I highly recommend this phone if you're looking for a flagship level phone which is more affordable than most others in this bracket, yet offers a supreme user experience",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,The Greatest phone I ever had!! I'm computer science student and I know about technology a little bit. The processor speed is super. You can watch HD video online without any network problem . The camera 😱 is the best. It detectors different kinds of object. Also you can track any object manually. You can capture best photo in low light... I don't have words to express this phone. Just buy it and descover a great feature yourself.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Can't beat this phone for the sale price. Don't expect monthly updates from Huawei in the US, maybe quarterly. Camera is very good. Feels like a smaller phone, balance is great in the hand. Stereo sound is ok from speakers, but not as good as my Nexus 6P. USB earbuds sound great, best stock set I've ever had.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"

B078T2T2FL,"I love this Huawei Phone! After searching for a new phone over 6 months, finally got the one I really want. I’v been using iOS for almost 10 years and it’s the only device that made up my mind to switch to Android. The blue color is very pretty, and the cameras are awesome! The phone is very slim and a little smaller than iPhone Plus, but it is big enough to watch video. In my opinion, it’s the best phone in the market now.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"This is simply the best phone on the market to buy right now. Great price, magnificent battery life, awesome camera and speedy finger print reader. There is nothing to regret about buying such a wonderful device.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,Super happy with this phone. Image quality from raw file is very impressive. Took a little getting use to coming from iPhone 6 plus but I am very amazed at how far Android has come.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"It runs fast, quick picture, clear and natural.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"The phone comes with a screen protector pre-installed, so that not only saves you the cost of buying one, but also the hassle of putting it on, failing because one tiny dust got it, and having to buy another one. It also comes with a soft protector case, which is one less decision to make, which is really a pleasant experience. The hardware is fast, I play PUBG on it and the load time is fast and game play is smooth on high settings. Battery is also good, I charge it once a day because again, I play PUBG on it, as well as stream quite a bit of music, but usually it doesn't dip below 30% when I do charge. Camera takes crisp pictures and the display is bright and crisp as well. I also don't miss not having a SD Card slot as there is already 128 GB onboard.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"AUDIO: Sound quality is really good but earphone is not compatible at all (keep falling out of my ears.).

B078T2T2FL,"A great phone at a discounted price it's hard to pass up. Battery life is phenomenal, easily going 2 days with light/medium usage. The pro version doesn't have the same UI problems the international version has. It feels nice in my hands and is lightning responsive. No headphone jack which is a bummer but I typically use Bluetooth anyway so a note issue for me. And it's nice to come with a screen film and plastic case in the box.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,This is my first Wow-Way phone and its the best android phone I've used yet. From the screen to the battery and everything in between just works!

B078T2T2FL,This phone is the best phone I have ever had. Way better than the Galaxy s9 and works great on the metroPCS network. No wonder it was named phone of the year in 2017. No notification issues unless you turn on ultra battery saver mode but I don't and phone battery still lasts me 10+ hrs with moderate to heavy Snapchat and YouTube use.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"

As at today 12/13/18 the phone can no longer charge when plugged into AC and the parts cannot be found anywhere in the USA. Another flaw of the phone is that both the charging port and earplug are on the same port, causing lots of wear and tear on the plug in port. The charging port and the earphone port should be in different places.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I have had issues with my Samsung 6. When I had to replace it I hesitated to get another Samsung. I did not want an iphone. After reading the reviews of the Huawei Pro 20, I decided to purchase it. I called Huawei support to make sure I could transfer everything from my Samsung. The technician I spoke to encouraged me to buy the Huawei Mate 10 Pro since it had a US Warranty. I did that. Phoneclone was easy to use and in no time my phone was ready to go.I have had the phone for about a month and I am still getting used to all the camera functions but all in all, I am very pleased with the phone.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"First Huawei love it at this price, buy this to replace galaxy note 8,way better than that",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,I left Samsung 5 for this new Huawei so I'm definitely still getting used to new phone features. Be mindful that when you set up multiple levels of security (pswd and fingerprint) it may confuse system and continuously LOCK you out of the phone; forcing default to manufacturer settings (this is what the phone rep said when I called for assistance). After that initial frustration it's been smooth sailing! I will alter my review should the need arise....,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I was a little scared buying this phone because of reviews I have seen on YouTube, but honestly this phone has been great! Everything has been as advertised and worth the price! Great fingerprint sensor and fantastic battery life. Big HD screen and beautiful camera. Worth every penny",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"The phone is good. Reaction is fast, with large memory and storage. Recharging is very fast. The size is a little too big for me to carry by one hand. Compared to Chinese version, some functions are blocked in this unlocked US version, such as phone call recording. And the photos taken by the dual leica camera look not so perfect.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,Huawei has some of the best phones around. Had the mate 9 and now the 10 is awesome,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"My phone worked great.... For two whole weeks! Then calls were disconnecting, the phone would restart itself, and apps would close unexpectedly. I was not able to get in contact with support staff until 5 months in. Customer service is not standing by their product and I am being majorly inconvenienced. The phone has never even been dropped its in pristine condition. The customer service is disgraceful, and the phone quality is poor. I would not reccomend.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"So...I upgraded to this after using a Samsung Galaxy s3. I knew this would be a vast improvement but holy smokes this phone is awesome I would buy from Huawei the next time I need an upgrade for sure. My galaxy S3 just got so slow that I couldn't even take a picture on it without waiting 3+ minutes for the phone to respond. With the mate 10, I just put my finger over the fingerprint scanner and boom everything loads so fast, and the camera on this thing takes such high resolution photos everyone is blown away when they see the pics I've taken. Plus this thing takes photos so fast (without) blurring that sometimes I get people with their eyes closed. Overall, great phone I highly recommend it.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Prior to this phone, I had a well loved Nexus 6p that was on its second battery. Had to upgrade due to phone was too slow. Only complaint I have about this phone (if you can call it a complaint) is that there are not a lot of sturdy cases that fit this phone. Otherwise, it is fantastic in every way. And the battery life is insane! I can go 2 days without charging phone.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,I bought this phone for my girl but I love it. Camera is amazing. Plenty of storage for less than most phones. Easy to transfer info and came brand new in the packaging sealed. Very nice,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,Everything perfect I had tried it before gave to my relative in Asia .,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I own this phone for about 10 days. So far it works great. I found one small issue when I was installing a new screen protector. There are minor scratches on a screen. Usually I don't see them, but when I inspected carefully the screen when it was dark, I found them. I used the phone some time without any screen protector, but I used it very carefully and I highly suspect the scratches were from the very beginning. I don't have much concern about them, but be aware if you ant a perfect product - when you peel the factory screen protector, inspect the screen carefully.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"This phone is especially beautiful, it feels smooth and the display is big and clear. Especially its shooting function is easy to use, with large aperture, double lens, the photos are particularly beautiful, I like it very much！",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I've been using this as my daily driver for only a week or so, but absolutely love it!!! Very fast, great battery life, beautiful build and great ergonomics. Highly recommended!!! Have tried a lot of "" flagships"" lately and settled on the mate 10 Pro. Very, very happy. Go Huawei, go!!!",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"The Mate 10 pro is so good. I was an IPhone User and use IPhone 5-7P. IPhone was my favorite phone but IOS 11 makes me craze. There are some many bugs so I finally want to transfer to Android. I did a lot of research and finally choose Huawei mate 10 pro. I just receive it today and used for several hours. It is so good, especially the camera. It can recognize the object. The AI chip is the best. Very glad to have this phone. I will recommend to my friends.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,It has a 4000 mAh battery And its very aggressive with ram management. Stereo sound is great. Screen is awesome (size and visibility). Huawei did a great job with this one,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"This phone is everything I wanted and more. I am astounded by the speed and excellence of the camera, the accuracy of the GPS, the screen quality, and the aesthetic of the phone itself. It runs faster than anything I've ever had, has a genius processor that performs above and beyond all others, and it is definitely worth the price for a handheld computer. No down sides at all.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Best phone I've ever owned period . I've owned Samsung ,apple etc and this one blows them away for half the money.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,I have been in telecom for over 25 years. This is one of the best phones out there. Samsung you just got schooled. A MUST BUY.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,Pros Great battery life (mostly more than one day) And fast charge is really useful (30 min-%50) Great photos Good looking with size and shape Cons Untill now I don't have any con but there is always some cons for every phone and there will be. (I have just couple promlem with Android) Edit: there is no headphone jack so Can't use together headphone and charger,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,Was very doubting about this phone but turns out this thing is a powerful underdog in it's own little niche. Only downside is the inability to add external storage. Everything else is 8/10 at lowest and 9.5/10 at most.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Demasiado buen teléfono, solo un menor inconveniente... Unicamente la version plateada permite dua sim al menos la azul no.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Frickin' awesome! Perhaps I'm overly impressed because I've only had remedial phones in the past. But if this one is what a smartphone is? I'm all in! Super fast, super reliable. I highly recommended it! Somehow it just feels good.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,The best phone I have ever owned. Camera is amazing. Battery last days! Processer is fast as can be. Fingerprint scanner works flawlessly. Face recognition is great. Beautiful phone.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Have had it for about 4 months now. Crystal clear voice quality, excellent camera results, good ergonomics. Only thing that could have been better was if Tmobile allowed Wifi Calling on this phone but that is a carrier issue not a Huawei issue.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,Love it and it designed gorgeous and very popular in Europe! much better than IPhone,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,No wifi calling!!!,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Coming from a 4 year old HTC M9, this is an INSANE upgrade. To everyone considering buying something else, this is a top tier phone at a ridiculously low price tag of 650. I wouldn't have bought it if it didn't go on sale and amazon allowed me to pay for it in 5 monthly intervals.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"This is my first non-iphone and I really really like it, it's fast the photos are really good I can't say they're better than my iPhone 8 but I'm still in the beginning stages of using it. for my first Android phone it's awesome and I'm really happy with my purchase",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,This is a fantastic phone for the price with amazing battery life and zero issues. I have to rate it poorly due to Huawei's decision to exclude the US when rolling out the GPU Turbo update. It is supposedly a gigantic performance boost for the phone and every country will get it except the US. You have to wonder if you want to invest in a phone that will be out of date right after you buy it.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,This is one amazing phone. Fast and beautiful. Battery life is amazing and so is the camera.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I have had my Huawei Mate 10 Pro for over two months now, this phone is so amazing and impressive! I owned many iPhones and I have to say my Huawei outperformed them all. The picture quality is very good (dual camera, Leica camera), the storage space is plenty (128GB), the super charge is fast, and the battery life is long! Love love!",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,Great phone.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,But I would pay that much. She loves this phone already. Amazing photos and butter smooth OS. No more iPhone talk.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,Best phone every. Batrery very good. Space more than enough. Camera.. great quality.. over all a good buy. Only disappoinment is that it should have used 2 sim.. but other than that it's the best phone I have ever had.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I used to be an Apple guy, then moved to Samsung, and now I'm a Huawei guy. This phone is impressive! EMUI interface is great, quality is on point, and specs are amazing.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Absolutely terrible phone. Battery drain makes it unusable. Overheats as well. Had my first one replaced and now the same exact issue is happening, Huawei and Square trade both refuse to replace it again and want to repair it. Don't get ripped off by buying this piece of garbage.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,say no more,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,Es una gran maquina y tiene un lente súper poderoso. No he tenido ningún problema en más de 6 meses de uso,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"😍💕😍💕 simplemente quedé perdidamente enamorada de mi Mate 10 me he quedado muy satisfecha con esta marca. Una mezcla como de iPhone con sistema Android.. vaya! Estupendo, se adapta bien a mis necesidades diarias. Batería de calidad.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"The phone came is not new, it is evident that it was used. The charger is bent, the box is opened, the film on the screen is scratched. Not very happy with.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,I like this phone very much. It has a smooth feel. It comes with a screen protection film and a protective cover. It has a long standby time and charges fast. Connect TV with switch head and display as computer desktop and then the mobile phone can be used as touch control board for all kinds of operation.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,Amazing phone. Well worth the money. Has lots of features. Battery life and camera A-1. Makes quite a few iPhone owners jelly for the price. Using at&t pre paid and I get all kinds of unlimited hotspot data because the phone is unlocked amazing :),HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Coming from an iPhone 7 plus, and this thing completely blows it out of the water! I've always been an Android person so I may sound a little bias but don't get me wrong the iPhone was a good phone, just not my cup of tea. If you're thinking of buying this as your next time phone, don't hesitate.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,It is good。the price is reasonable.my boss bought it first.introduce me to buy.compare to the iPhone.it is cheaper.function is good.anyhow.i like it,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Excellent phone, still outperforms many of the iphones out there. I have an iPhone 8 for work and this Mate 10 pro as my personal phone. The Mate 10 Pro is faster on surfing the web, music streaming and unlocking the phone.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,Great Phone.! Highly recommended,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,excellent device i love this phone! i have had the pixel and the note and this is the best phone i have ever had and the customer service is amazing!,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,I have to say this phone works better than Apple and Samsung phones. It works very well and is an excellent price,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Bought this to replace my Nuu G3. This thing is amazing. Battery lasts all day with ease, even with a lot of gaming. Display is absolutely gorgeous! Dual speakers sounds good. Didn't take long at all to get used to the emui skin. Fully recommend this to everyone",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"A great smartphone, but a buggy messaging app due to an error of downloading or receiving mms occur after a security software update. It looks like Huaweii has abandoned the android pie update for the US variant. I had to return it for a full refund.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,I own a Samsung note8 and this Huawei phone was my 1st purchase or dealing with this brand. I am 100% happy with everything about this phone. The price you cannot beat a is equal to Samsung or iPhone.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"The headline more or less sums it up. The phone thus far has proven durable, with a nice screen, good brightness, excellent battery life (4amph battery, so what else would you have expected? 8). A bit thicker and heavier than I expected after playing with the 3i. Also doesn't come in that beautiful pearlescent blue, but, what you gonna do?",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Loving this phone, glad I didn't listen to all of the things surrounding the company, great phone easy to use if you are used to Android and there are cool features too.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Best phone ever. I needed a new phone and I was between this one, Samsung Note 9, and Google pixel. This is the best looking phone, way better camera, it works great with my wireless headphones, and the blue is the best.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Amazing phone! Top notch build, battery life, camera, headphone audio quality and performance. Don't believe certain reviews about how the software is bad, it's not. Wonderfully done Huawei!",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"For the price, it's a solid buy. Although the fingerprint reader and face recognition weren't the best after a while, it did the job it was designed to do. Screen quality is surprisingly solid and fits well in my hand when I'm using it in bed. It has gotten wet a few times but after a good wipe, there didn't seem to be any internal damage at all. Don't regret the purchase.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Works just like it said it would! Easy to apply, and came with the little prep kit to get my phone ready to go!",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,It's a beautiful phone with an amazing camera and a big screen. Its a decent quality phone for this price.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I bought this phone in July it is now November and already have a huge failure. It no longer fast charges, charger included doesn't even work now. Phone takes 6-8 hours to charge sometimes longer, I have to charge via computer now. Will not work with included headphones or adapter won't even register that they are plugged in. I have contacted the company to see what the ""us warranty"" will be able to do for me.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I tried to install few Huawei phone software's but they don't install since they are not able to contact the server. Not sure, if it is just me or same across US.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,It's smaller than I imagined. It's as long as my mate two but a bit more than half inch in width shorter.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"was a mate 9 user, want this mate10 pro since it just released. great phone, light weight big screen, the camera is awsome.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Solid battery life, amazing pictures and lightning quick processor!",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"

B078T2T2FL,"I love this phone, it is the best phone I have ever owned, the display is flawless, and this thing has all of the best features that Galaxy and iPhone have but better. The camera is simply amazing and goes great with this amazing display. I would recommend this phone to all who dare to be different and gooutside societal norms!!",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Lightning fast, highly usable and convenient features and functions, limited bloatware, sharp and colorful screen, all for about half the price of an equivalent iPhone.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,Good phone is easy to set up. So far I've had a good experience with it.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I'm coming from a Google Pixel XL, and this phone just crushes it to pieces. Almost everything about it is phenomenal. Yeah EMUI is a tad bid dated, but nothing Nova Launcher can't fix. The first week battery life was kinda meh, but after a week it REALLY turned around. On my old Pixel I would usually leave work after a 12 hour shift on about 30% with excellent signal coverage while listening to music and watching videos on break occasionally. With this thing, I do all that and more and leave with 60% battery which is just insane. Although it doesn't have a headphone jack, it kicks it pretty decent sound with a nice pair of USB C headphones. It's quick, responsive, and gorgeous to look at. I'm still learning how to work the camera, so far I've gotten decent shots but it's still not comparing to the 1st Gen Pixel camera, but it's almost there when I figure out how to handle exposure in the pro mode. All in all, I haven't loved a phone this much since the HTC M8. Truly a great device.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"The product itself is wonderful , high configuration and reasonable price. But the delivery service is not very good .",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I am pleased with my purchase of this cell phone. The Huawei Mate Porsche Design has certainly lived up to it's positive reputation. It is not only a beautiful phone, it functions smoothly and efficiently. No lag in it's software.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,The fact that this phone has a better battery life than the iPhone x is what got me to get it.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Just got it today. It arrived intact no dmg to the packaging thats a +, the phone started with no problems. I am yet to play around with it, but from hour messing around with it i can say that im in love. Honestly anything is better than the first LG Stylo that was released.. which was with a 2gb ram and 16 gb of hard drive.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,This phone has been perfect. So glad that I purchased this over a Samsung. Android fan and extremely pleased with this purchase.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,Audio resounds.. spoiled the entire experience.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,La verdad el teléfono esta muy bien por el precio excelente calidad de materiales y diseño tiene una excelente definición además de la cámara increíble la batería de igual manera yo lo utilizo mucho todo el día con aplicaciones y solamente uso un pequeño porcentaje de batería. El único problema que tengo es que a veces me cuesta conectarme al Bluetooth o se me desconecta.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"wish the fingerprint scanner was on the front; still very new to me but holding a great battery charge, good photos, etc.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,Very nice looking phone camera is pretty good. The volume is not high wish the speakers work better.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"This is the American version of Mate 10 pro, which is designed to use in North America. I just fell it from the second floor and there isn't even a small damage. Trust me, buy it right now!",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"The build and look quality.. Awesome phone. The display is beautiful. Camera is not perfect but picture come out pretty good. Sound on earphone are pretty good to my tastes. Call quality is outstanding, would recommend..",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I just receive it and till now, I love it. I works very fast. About the quality, still wait to see its performance.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"I love the phone, but its smaller than Mate 9. I was very disappointed. But i love the battery and its a great phone over all",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Me gusta es rápido y el tamaño, hice un buen negocio.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,Bought this for my roommate and no complaints actually liked this better than the Galaxy 9+ I have! Which is very comparable,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,This phone need software update so Huawei back your product if you want people to recommend it to others.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,my husband bought this phone as a gift to his friend. His friend love the phone so much. The phone thin and light when he hold it. Good price too,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,It's my first android phone and it is so fast! The battery never drains within a day - it's so common for me to have 50% left when I recharge it before going to bed (unlike my old iPhone) - and I have never seen a fingerprint sensor so fast - it unlocks my phone literally the moment I sweep my finger across it! Plus the sensor at the back is at such a convenient location that I just need to hold my phone as normal and my finger just touches it with ease. Surprisingly the phone also arrived with a screen protector already applied (just peel off the top dust protection layer and you are done) as well as a transparent phone case from Huawei itself - no other shopping necessary! These may be trivial services to someone else but they really do save me lots of time (got the phone out of the box and used it right away) so I am really pleased!,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Best phone you have never heard of. If you want to stand out in a oversaturated market of Samsung and apple, this is the phone to achieve that with. Simply a beautiful piece of machinery.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,perfect for photo,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"It works fine, great battery durity. Just not so used to its system. I had used iPhone for many years, but got tired of their unreasonable price and design.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,So far so good. Very satisfied with the camera and battery life. I live in a remote area where Tmobile signal is weak. This phone has better reception than my previous one.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,Excellent pictures and battery life.,HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"So I've upgraded to a Mate 10 Pro from a Mate 9 which was an upgrade from a Panasonic DMC-CM1. My holy grail: a really good phone, combined with a really good camera, with a large-ish screen that fits my large-ish hands. I have both the Mate 10 Pro and the Mate 9 in hand right now, with the intent to keep the one that I prefer. I am likely going to be keeping the Mate 10 Pro. Where It's Better than Mate 9 - Viewing angles on screen - Light evenness on screen - Performance (slightly) - Maximum camera aperture (f/1.6 vs. f/2.2—the primary reason I'm upgrading) - Built-in memory capacity (128GB vs 64GB) Where Mate 9 is Better (IMO) - Screen size (both are 6"" diagonal, but the 9 is 16:9 HD, while the Mate 10 is 18:9 and has less area) - Dual SIM capable and SD capable (Mate 10 Pro is one SIM, no SD) - Build quality (not a fan of all-glass) - Speakers (Mate 9 has more of them and they sound better) - Screen color (richer than Mate 10 Pro, which is odd, because 9 is IPS while Mate 10 Pro is AMOLED) At the end of the day, both the Mate 10 Pro and the Mate 9 are VERY good to excellent Android phones, easily a match for any manufacturer's flagships right now. Blindingly fast and smooth, great screens, industry-leading battery life and battery optimization, industry-leading fingerprint scanner, great compatibility, just a joy to use all around. The Camera Question If you're like me, however, the main reason you were drawn to these phones is for the camera. On this front, neither is as good as the Panasonic DMC-CM1 (nothing else on the market is, either). I still miss it daily, but the phone half of that phone was getting to be too old to be usable as a phone. The Mate 9 at max f/2.2 aperture is pretty good, but noise reduction artifacts become an issue indoors and in dimmer light. Enough of an issue to bug me and cause me to invest in the Mate 10 Pro as an experiment for comparison. Also, the tiny sensor and f/2.2 aperture just meant absolutely no DOF control whatsoever. Yes, there is software simulation of shallow DOF, but it only really works for portraits—when there is something in the foreground and something in the background. If you want to see this software simulation fall down quickly, just get something long (a bridge, railroad tracks, a subject lying down) and photograph them using software DOF mode. The part nearest the lens will be in focus. The part farthest away from the lens will be blurred. And in the middle, rather than a gradual transition (as you would get from a real wide aperture lens on a large sensor), you see a sudden transition from sharp to blurry where the software decided the transition from ""foreground"" to ""background"" happens. In short, it's not real DOF control and in most non-portrait shooting situations, it just can't be made to look like real DOF control. That said, I do very much like the rest of the image quality coming out of the Mate 9/10 series, particularly in RAW mode. So the goal became to get the largest aperture possible for this tiny sensor. That is f/1.6 on the Mate 10 Pro. Is it worth the upgrade? For me it is. What would my ideal be? Probably the Mate 10 Pro camera in the Mate 9 body. Or even better, the same camera module but with an f/1.0 lens (I don't mind if it protrudes a bit like some other phones) in the Mate 9 body. But you go with what's available—and that's the Mate 10 Pro, for now. Five stars because in comparison to all the other phones on the market, it's amongst the top 2-3, if not the very top.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"
B078T2T2FL,"Great phone! I'm using T-Mobile with this home and it is working prefect! Big battery, fast, and great screen!",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"

I use phone for couple things: make calls, GPS and browse internet. Compare iPhone, there are couple things I like better: 1. the finger print, it's much sensitive and easy to use. 2. it can open mutiple apps at the same time and easy to navigate through them. 3. Much, much better GPS 4. Much, much stronger signal, especially the wifi. 5. it comes with the installed screen protector and phone case. 6. setup on this phone is much easier than iPhone. I just need to search on the phone instead of google for it. I also took couple photos and they look better than iPhone too. The only thing I don't like is the out box screen icons. I don't like go through screens to find my app, it should have more icons on the home screen.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"

B078T2T2FL,"There is really a lot to like about this phone but a few issues might be a deal breaker for me. I always use high end phones and was currently using the Pixel 2 XL before this phone. From an aesthetics standpoint, this phone blows the Pixel away but my problem is EMUI. Here are the things I love; 1) In my opinion, this is the nicest looking phone on the market and it feels great in the hand. A major plus for this. 2) Call quality is excellent. I think it gets better reception and sound great on both ends. 3) Battery & Fast charging. I won't dive too deep into this but this phone is a beast on battery life. I typically have at least 40% remaining by the time I go to bed where in the past, I would have had to put a phone on the charger. Kudos for this. 4) The speakers sound really good. Not quite as loud as the Pixel, but that is because the lower speaker is on the bottom. Still, it sounds really good. 5) Pretty easy setup with the Huawei smart switch but Android is petty easy anyway. Still, took about a half hour to transfer everything. 6) Fingerprint scanner is the fastest and most accurate I have ever seen. This is important to me since EMUI does not support Smart Lock. More on that in the negatives. Now the negatives; 1) I'm not a huge fan of EMUI. It is a lot better than it used to be, but I feel like I need a manual to figure it all out. Tons of hidden menus / sub menus 2) Scrolling video works poorly. I am not referring to watching a video or live stream, I am referring to events. I use Nest cameras and could normally scroll through events. On this phone, it just turns black and blurry. I've tried this on two different phones and they are exactly the same. On the Pixel 2, as well as my wife's Iphone, it scrolls perfectly. It has nothing to do with the wifi or signal either as both are great. Just keep this in mind if you are using a Nest camera system. 3) My call blocker is useless with EMUI. I have tried every setting suggested by TrueCaller, and nothing works. All calls come right through. This could be a deal breaker for me as I am overwhelmed with solicitations and spam calls. There is an internal blocker but I need specific types of calls blocked. 4) Alerts are hit or miss. Sometime you get them, and sometimes you don't as evidenced by my Ring Pro doorbell. This is both in the office, and home. I have done a hard reset, cleared the cache, and also tried reinstalling the app. This is not a deal breaker but I don't understand why it does not work all of the time. 5) EMUI does not use the android smart lock feature. In my opinion, this is one of the best features of android. Basically the system is programmed to know and trust you so it will not lock in the designated areas. This feature does not exist in EMUI except a bluetooth function that sort of does a similar function, but only works half of the time. If you are like me, and constantly picking up your phone, and putting it down, it is an extra step to have to always unlock it. I have no idea why Huawei would not use the android smart lock function. Ok, so I am not saying this is not a great phone. It is but it lacks the specific functions I use and need on a daily basis. I am trying to love it, and still not sure if I will keep it or not but if I am unable to get a bit more consistency from it, I think it's going back. I will give it a couple of weeks to see if the AI chip learns or changes anything. Just my opinion for what it's worth. Edit 3/4/18 I really tried to like this phone, and unfortunately, I really do like it. However, after several attempts with Huawei to get the blockers working, and the issues with my notifications, the phone is going back. I tried everything from factory resets, to any and all possibilities. More than I have ever done to try to get this phone to work as needed. I could honestly say that this could be my favorite phone I have ever used but the lack of necessary features just kill it for me. Back it goes.",HUAWEI,"July 2, 2021"

B0000SX2UC,"I had the Samsung A600 for awhile which is absolute doo doo. You can read my review on it and detect my rage at the stupid thing. It finally died on me so I used this Nokia phone I bought in a garage sale for $1. I wonder y she sold it so cheap?... Bad: ===> I hate the menu. It takes forever to get to what you want because you have to scroll endlessly. Usually phones have numbered categories so u can simply press the # and get where you want to go. ===> It's a pain to put it on silent or vibrate. If you're in class and it rings, you have to turn it off immediately. There's no fast way to silence the damn thing. Always remember to put it on silent! I learned that the hard way. ===> It's so true about the case. It's a mission to get off and will break ur nails in the process. Also, you'll damage the case each time u try. For some reason the phone started giving me problems once I did succeed in opening it. ===> Buttons could be a bit bigger. Vibration could be stronger. Good: ===> Reception is not too shabby. I was using it in the elevator which is a remarkable feat considering my old phone would lose service by simply putting it in my pocket. ===> Compared to my old Samsung, this phone works quite well. The ring tones are loud enough to hear and the phone actually charges quickly and has great battery life. It doesn't heat up like a potatoe in the oven either during long phone convos. ===> Nice bright, large screen. ===> Cute ways to customize it. Scroll bar can be set to purple, pink, aqua, orange, etc. Overall: Okay phone. It serves its purpose but definitely pales in comparison to these new phones coming out from Sprint. Why get so so when you can get great?",Nokia,"July 11, 2021"
B0000SX2UC,"Due to a software issue between Nokia and Sprint this phone's text messaging capabilities don't work with Sprint's system and won't until a software patch comes out ""some time in the next few months"". You will have to spend at least 1 hour with Sprint's award winning customer service team to find someone who will admit this to you. The problem is that Nokia designed their phones so that incoming messages are retrieved quickly and then viewed ""offline"" the way most providers work. Sprint, however, likes to have people hook up to their server first and then stay connected, burning minutes while they check their inbox, compose a reply and wait for the Sprint server to respond so they can send it out. Innovation in money-making at its finest.",Nokia,"July 11, 2021"
B0000SX2UC,"This is a great, reliable phone. I also purchased this phone after my samsung A460 died. The menu is easily comprehendable and speed dialing is available for around 300 numbers. Voice dialing is also a nice feature, but it takes longer than speed dialing. The only thing that bothers me is the games...Nokia seems to have taken snake (1 and 2) off their phones. There is a skydiving game, bowling, and tennis (like pong). The ringers are very nice, and a feature is available to choose a different ringer for each person calling. However, ringtones are not available online to download to this phone. You're pretty much stuck with what you have. There are vibrating ringtones and regular (midi) polyphonic tones. All they need are covers in a reasonable price range...",Nokia,"July 11, 2021"
B0000SX2UC,"I love the phone and all, because I really did need one, but I didn't expect the price of the bill when I received one. Also, I've had my phone for a little over two months now and still have yet to receive my free accessories that were supposed to come with the phone. Every time I call the company, they keep telling me to wait a couple of weeks, and that I should be receiving it shortly. Other than that, I do love the phone and all that I am able to do with it; and I'm not just talking about making the phone calls! :)",Nokia,"July 11, 2021"
B0000SX2UC,"The phone has been great for every purpose it offers, except the day i bought it-i couldnt get the case off. You can take the case off to put your own pictures in the jaket which is super cool, but when i took it back to the store-an employee said they were meant to be hard to get off. Well, he could barely even get it off- he came close to snapping the casing in half. I was never able to get it off after that which isnt THAT big of a deal, but it got dirty under the clear casing and it looks really dirty now. MAKE SURE YOU CAN GET YOUR CASE ON AND OFF! Oh and you have to charge it ALL off the time.",Nokia,"July 11, 2021"
B0000SX2UC,"Hello, I have this phone and used it until I decided to buy a flip phone. I have had NO problems with the battery or new cases--it has a new fish case on it now and it stays as well as the original one. I have added ring tones, and music so it was all good for me--as a matter of fact I am willing to sell this phone, the home charger and the car charger for a great deal--email me--(...)",Nokia,"July 11, 2021"
B0000SX2UC,"Cool. Cheap. Color: 3 words that describe the Nokia 3588 perfectly. I mean, what more DO you want? This beauty's got classic, sleek looks that jerks you a little about a Nokia 3310's looks. The 3588 also has some amazing ringtones. And I own a cellphone shop, so I have the experience. I RATE THIS THE 5TH BEST PHONE THAT I'VE EVER COME ACROSS IN MY STORE. Do you need more prompting to buy this, pal? Well, then here it comes!: The Nokia 3599 includes an alarm clock, calendar, voice recorder, calculator and stopwatch . And trust me, its good value for money if you're on a tight budget. And oh, if you're thinking of getting this for a teenager, you've come to the right phone; they'll go crazy after its looks AND its color LCD (which happens to be a little oversize). If this phone's goin' for an adult, you've hit da soda pop again, you lucky person! NOW are ya convinced that this mobile's REAL! (it is).",Nokia,"July 11, 2021"
B0000SX2UC,"The 3599i is overall a nice phone, except that Nokia made its universal headset jack incompatible with most 2.5mm universal headsets (even their own). A phone call to tech support was required to find out that you need to buy a headset that plugs into the Pop-port accessory connector on the bottom of the phone. They ended up suggesting the HDB-5 headset.",Nokia,"July 11, 2021"
B0000SX2UC,"I've never owned a Nokia phone before, so this is a first for me. I really like the phone alot, the reception is great...even though the signal strength show's being low. The quality of the phone is great too, it feels sturdy and weighted. I highly recommend this phone.",Nokia,"July 11, 2021"
B0000SX2UC,ok well im in school and i need the text messaging and ive had this phone for about a month and text messaging was supposed to start working 2weeks ago.A conflict of software type stuff and btween nokia and sprint.(Its down to 4 stars) And the fact it cant download ringtones.(3stars)Or games(2 stars)But you cant beat a nearfree or free color phone(back to 3 stars) as soon as it gets text messaging it should b 4 stars.,Nokia,"July 11, 2021"
B0000SX2UC,"I've had this phone for over a year and I really like it. Having never been partial to flip phones, I can appreciate this Nokia's features. The color screen is very nice and all of the features are easy to use. The keylock is a simple two-button sequence though I do wish it had a timer for the keylock like my old phone. It has a lot of useful features, like a calculator, organizer, stopwatch and alarm, but the three games it has are too lame to play. The customizable features are nice, but lacking in variety. This isn't the ideal phone for a guy. You're few options are pretty girly. The ringtones also lack something to be desired, but there are a few decent ones. The battery life is pretty good, nothing special, but definitely not bad. It gets me through the average day without problems and sometimes lasts for several days. My parents, sisters, and husband all got fancy Samsung flip phones with cameras and all the toys, and I must say mine works better. The battery lasts MUCH longer and the recpetion is MUCH better. The downside to this cute phone is the case. It's made of very weak plastic that cracked in a few months. Also, if you're thinking about getting a different case for it, DON'T! Once you take it off, it will keep slipping off. It never attaches firmly again, and neither does the new case you bought. I've read this in other reviews too. Because of this, the last time I dropped it the back piece popped off and the battery flew out. Now my phone has issues. Drat. Overall, it's a great phone, if you're content with the simpler things in life. Who really uses the camera on thier phone anyway? I just reccommend buying a protective case for it and leaving it on and don't drop the delicate thing.",Nokia,"July 11, 2021"
B0000SX2UC,"1.) Slow - If you want to check your missed calls list, this phone feels compelled to inform you whether or not there are any new calls in the list...it does this for about 20 seconds. Of course, it will take you half a second to read the message...and you probably don't care about what it says. 2.) Annoying - Ever had anyone scream in your ear? That's a sensation I get from this phone on a regular basis. It has the nice ability to attach a voice tag to a phone number...a useful feature...when it works. About 80% of the time, it recognizes the number I ask for, the other 20% it lets me know that it doesn't understand...by screeching (next to my head). Want to know what that feels like with your phone? Turn the ringer up to the highest setting, hold the phone next to your ear, call your phone. Not pleasant. Add to this the fact that when you're searching one of the numerous menus on the phone (menus that have at least 5 items in them), the menu system uses up a whole screen to display one line of text. It has three lines available to it...but it uses one. What's next? What did you just pass? Go back and look, can't find out another way! 3.) Fragile - My phone is cracked. Why you ask? Because I took off the battery cover. Why did you take off the battery cover you ask? Because I wanted to write this review and that was the only way to find out the model number. 4.) Heavy - Speaks for itself...the phone weighs way too much. 5.) Bulky - Again, like heavy, speaks for itself. My recommendation: buy a better phone. This one will only make you cry at night.",Nokia,"July 11, 2021"
B0000SX2UC,"I bought this phone about a year ago and have been using it ever since, on the Sprint PCS network, to replace an old TP2100. The first time I bought it, the phone was defective, so I had to get it replaced after a few days. I liked the phone okay at first, but I really wish I can go back in time and buy a better phone. Several issues: *mediocre reception. *rather bulky and unattractive. *cheap feel, cheaply made, cheap materials. *screen not easily visible in bright sunlight. *battery life marginal. I will go into a little detail about a few things. I get okay reception on this phone. It is NOT GOOD reception. The phone will work in areas where there is a good signal, but in areas with a marginal signal, such as my apartment, the phone will drop calls left and right, and fade in and out about 5 seconds of every minute (this is outside, so interference from the building is not the cause). In my residence, I use my husband's Sanyo, as it gets an excellent signal, and doesn't drop nearly as many calls. I have had Sprint check out the phone, and they say it is working correctly. I can only assume it is the poor quality of the phone that is to blame. The phone is quite big for what I would expect from a modern phone, with no camera. In a small purse, it takes up a lot of room. What is more important is that the phone is cheaply made, and has a cheap feel to it. It's made out of rather flimsy plastic. I dropped the phone once onto concrete from about 3 feet up, and the antenna head got a crack in it and a corner of the phone got serious scratches. Also, the screen can be difficult to read in bright sunlight, but it's quite bright otherwise. As far as battery life goes, it's not that great. I've gone to bed with the battery half full and have woken up to a dead phone. I believe the poor reception in my immediate area is to blame, as the phone searches for a signal and that takes battery time. Talk time is decent. Pros: *LOUD ringer *lots of features, but I rarely use them.",Nokia,"July 11, 2021"
B0000SX2UC,This is an excellent choice for Sprint to use when enrolling new customers for service. It is the free option for most new customers and it has been excellent after a year of ownership. I love how it lights up when someone is calling which helps to really find the phone quickly when you are in the dark. If you have the phone in a purse it really makes it easy to find due to this fact. The Nokia phone seems to be tougher to me than the Samsung phones at the Sprint store also. So my only issue with the phone is the fact that since it is not a flip phone the keypad must be locked before I drop the phone in my pants pocket. This can be annoying if you get used to owning a flip phone before moving to the Nokia.,Nokia,"July 11, 2021"
B00198M12M,"I've owned this phone now for 5 years and have just replaced it due to its age and me beating the tar out of it. Doesn't look like it will be available for much longer as it is no longer in production. I'm not interested in owning a smart phone, don't get me wrong I love new technologies I'm just not a fan of all-in-one devices that you can't swap or upgrade components on. So on that thought a phone should be a phone and a tablet should just be a tablet. Overall this phone is durable, rugged and offers some easy to use features that allow you to carry a few less ""tools"" when you are moblie.",Nokia,"March 28, 2021"
B00198M12M,"I highly doubt this phone is a genuine Nokia product. The battery door does not fit properly, the battery fits but the plastic guard on the side opposite the contacts is separated once inserting the battery due to poor fit. This is not nokia quality your used to, it must be some sort of a clone. Packaging looks authentic albeit generic. Totally disappointed by this purchase",Nokia,"March 28, 2021"
B00198M12M,"Over the past decade I have been through half a dozen cell phones. With a brief (and unsatisfactory) PANASONIC interlude, I have always gone NOKIA and did not regret it. My previous phone was NOKIA 6230i, a stylish working horse that, after three years of non-stop use, lately kept having ringer failure. I loved my phone and, although realized its time was up, did not want to have to familiarize myself with a whole different Menu SetUp. The NOKIA 6500-SLIDER was the perfect choice. It has a beautiful and robust brushed-steel finish, a large screen of impressive quality and one of the best phone cameras available (a 3.2Mpixels sensor behind an autofocus Carl Zeiss lens with flash). An important detail: the brushed steel is NOT that sensitive to fingerprint marks and will not require the constant wiping that other metal models do. The menu is intuitive and easy to use even if new to NOKIA 6-series. The buttons are large enough for adult fingers and, important for a slider phone, even the top buttons are fully accessible. Like most NOKIAs, the phone is greatly customizable, from colors and sounds to wallpapers and screensavers. It is robustly built and the slider glides easily in place with zero wobbling. NOKIA 6500-SLIDER is a beautiful phone that can be your helper for years. My only complaints are actually...three: (1) the very limited OnBoard memory (it has only 20MB - when my older 6230i had almost double that). Since only mp3s and photos stored on the Phone memory are guarantied to work when used as ring-tones or contact/group images, to have a cavernous 256MB Memory Card yet a puny 20MB OnBoard capacity seems ironic. (2) the placement of the speakerphone in the...back of the phone. Activate it and the phone speaks to your desk, voices coming out all muffled; and (3) the absence of photo stabilization. It may seem excessive for a phone, however when increasing the pixel number beyond 3M, image stabilization is actually essential if photos of any value are to be taken. All in all, an excellent stylish phone that, (six months after its initial release) should be available at bargain prices.",Nokia,"March 28, 2021"
B00198M12M,I have had very good experiences with Nokia phones but we've had this thing repaired 3 times in the last year and it just went dead. I'm going to something else.,Nokia,"March 28, 2021"
B00198M12M,"The quality of this Nokia 6300 slide, I was going to have as a souvenir, is completely different from the one used to be when I had it brand new in 2008 which was made not in China. This one looks and feels really crappy. The picture on the screen is not straight with the body shape of the devise, the sell phone feels much lighter as compared with it used to be. The back cover was damaged when I first take the sell phone out to put the battery in.",Nokia,"March 28, 2021"
B001GQ3DJM,"Short: This phone works fine as a basic phone, if that is all you are looking for. Long: My old phone's LCD croaked on me, and I wanted to wait a bit before buying an HTC Dream, so I went with this cheap phone. Complaints: Menu/key response is sometimes slow. No way to get data to phone via USB cable, at least if you live in the US. It seems like a USB cable exists (in Europe, Asia and Australia) but it costs about as much as the phone itself does after exchange rates. If you go to [...], they talk about cable CA-126, which works with the 1680. It has a regular usb connector on one end, and a Nokia microusb & 2.5mm charger plug on the other. The US Nokia manual says the Microusb port is for ""authorized personal only"", which to my mind says that the carriers in the US wanted to force people into getting things onto the phone via some $$$-chargeable method. In any event, I'll be getting a new phone in a few months so I'll live with this phone for now. But the limitations it has makes it so that it is only suitable for those who are not looking for anything other than making/receiving phone calls (like my parents).",Nokia,"November 18, 2021"
B001GQ3DJM,"The good news is that it has a long battery life and is lightweight. But none of that is worth anything if you cant hear the other person. I had a Samsung and a Sony before and never had this problem. The keypad is tough, requiring sledge hammer to push the keys. Bottom line: the phone is cheap, but you get what you pay for. Try Sony or Samsung, their cheapest models work better than this.",Nokia,"November 18, 2021"
B001GQ3DJM,"I needed a replacement phone, and did not want to sign up for a new contract, so I bought a Nokia 1680c at the full retail price. This phone is a good value. It rings loud & clear, and the speakerphone is easy to hear. People I'm calling say my voice is clear, though they can tell I'm on a cell phone. It has a lot of neat software features; for example, you can configure a shortcut action for the left and right softkeys, as well the Up-Down-Left-Right buttons. There is no dedicated rocker switch on the side for volume up & down; during a call, the volume is adjusted by the Left and Right buttons. The phone is constructed well, but feels too light. Battery life is very good. The screen is bright and clear. Navigating menus can be a little sluggish. The keypad is stiff, making text messaging a chore. No Bluetooth connectivity, so forget about using one of those fancy headsets. The box does include a wired earbud/microphone with integrated call answer/end button. Something that annoyed me was how it saved numbers to the address book from an incoming call; the Nokia software puts a ""+"" symbol in front of incoming call numbers. That gets saved to the address book -- for example ""+15551212121"" -- a minor thing, and something probably more useful for European phone numbers, for example. Overall, I like this phone, and will probably keep it until I someday feel the need to get a smartphone-type slab of electronics.",Nokia,"November 18, 2021"
B0027VKQPE,"I love this phone. Retro early 2000s kind of phone. Light and handy size. Good battery life, good signal. You need to call Tracfone customer service though, for a new sim card and to help you activate the phone (buy a prepaid card first before you call) Great back up phone for people with a smartphone, or a main phone for people who have low phone usage, and just does a couple of text messages or a couple minute calls a day.",Nokia,"January 30, 2021"
B0027VKQPE,The best phone I have used say 10 years back and when I saw a new one wanted to have it. You cant go wrong with this phone as a basic phone.,Nokia,"January 30, 2021"
B0027VKQPE,Arrived a day early but SIM card registration failed and the unlock codes don't work. Consider returning it since it's defective.,Nokia,"January 30, 2021"
B0027VKQPE,"I've had this phone for eons---at least 10 years, more like 12. My Nokia 1100 has been dropped many times where the back flies off and the battery flies out. It just keeps on working. No cracks or breaks. This thing has been dropped on cement more than once!! I just quit using it a week ago because I wasn't getting text messages sent from newer phones. It would come through as unreadable with the numbers 11001010 or something similar and I couldn't see who it was from either (if anyone knows how to remedy this, please tell me so I can go back to using this one!). This is my favorite phone. I also have a Samsung SGH-S425G and most recently added the Samsung Galaxy Stardust (all through Tracfone). The reason I like this Nokia 1100---I can text without ever looking at it because of the raised buttons. People with smart phones like to tell me that their phone has word prediction, which is when I get to tell them that this one does too! (Just gotta read the manual to see how to press the buttons once while spelling to get a list of suggested words). My smart phone takes me longer to do everything because it has too much stuff on it. With this one, I can make a call with 3 button presses, maybe 2. Not so on newer phones with more menus. If it weren't for needing to get text messages (work), I'd totally still be using this phone!!!!!",Nokia,"January 30, 2021"
B0027VKQPE,"I have had my 1100b for several (>5) years and it was a cast off from my wife who used it for a couple of years before it became mine. I plan on keeping it until it becomes unusable. The phone is simple,no camera, monochrome display and some simple games. It is very sturdy and has exceptional battery life between charges. For more details see the wikipedea article on it. I do not use my phone very much so trac phone works well for me. To put it simply: a pay as you go set up like trac phone is good if you want to HAVE a cell phone but don't plan on USING it all the time. It is a cheap way to have one availible but could get expensive if you do not manange your minutes or if you use the phone alot like some people seem to do.",Nokia,"January 30, 2021"
B0027VKQPE,"I'm still using one of these as my phone. It has great battery life, and works pretty much everywhere I go. The one exception is my sister's house, but then nobody's cell phone can seem to get a decent signal there. I don't text, so having something that is just a phone is perfect for me. It does have one special feature, there is an LED flashlight built into the top end of the case. That light has come in handy on a number of occasions. Personally I like the Tracfone service. I pay around $99 a year for the service and I've purchased the double-minute card so that I get twice the minutes. Minutes accumulate as you go. It's too bad they quit selling this model.",Nokia,"January 30, 2021"
B0027VKQPE,"I used to have a Nokia 1100. They are simplistic, indestructible and have near infinite battery life. (I often charged it like once every other week!) They are primarily made for sale in developing countries. As for Tracfone, I have no idea.",Nokia,"January 30, 2021"
B0027VKQPE,"came with no sim card not in the box like the picture, don't waste your time with this",Nokia,"January 30, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"Well ... Despite all the crap that falls on Nokia with WP, I can only say one thing: it's AWESOME. Its fluidity, speed, usability and portability are impressive. It is very stable and resistant! And that's little compared to what a Lumia 920 really is with WP. I bought it on October 31, 2014 (yes, two years ago) and today it works great, and taking into account that I use it daily and continuously and exhaustively (Asphalt 8, usually). The only thing that sometimes annoys is that the battery takes almost 1:30 mins to charge, and still works perfectly. The applications I use are already in WP, so I am not at all jealous of any Android / iPhone. Oh, and regarding the seller, it is very fulfilled. In the stipulated time the cell phone arrived at my destination (I use virtual lockers, I live in Colombia) Just need to buy a new screen protector and a case, and it's like the first day of use. And I would not trade it for anything (maybe for a Lumia 940 or a Lumia 1020).",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"I am a big fan of the Windows Phone OS, and I really like the design of the Lumia devices. This has a large, bright screen, very easy to use. Takes GREAT pictures. The built in wireless charging is a great feature. The bad. Is heavy. Is fragile. Do not believe the YouTube videos where they throw one of these at a brick wall and it is unscathed. First one, my daughter (first day she got it), dropped it off her elevated bed. It hit every step of the ladder on the way down. Screen shattered. Second one (1 and 2 purchased at same time). My wife after about a year, sort of flipped it up in the air accidently and it hit the tile floor. Screen shattered. OK, I'll give Lumia 1 and 2, but number 3, daughter about a week after she got it, dropped from waist high on to a laminate floor. Screen shattered.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"Best phone I ever owned. Had a note 4 before this one in almost every aspect this is better except screen size. Camera, way better! OS, the best on the market! App store, is building and gets all the popular apps. Windows acts as a buffer for apps. Only good, working apps are accepted, so it will never have as many as apple nor Android as they accept anything no matter the risk especially Android, which I like a lot more than apple. I rarely see an IPhone with a clear screen. The resolution on this phone is a lot better than most phones aside from the 1020 and 1520. Microsoft puts a lot on stronger software than strong hardware. Which can be seen in cheaper models. With this phone both soft and hardware are powerful. Although the others have more games this phone offers a wide variety of Xbox live games that can only be found on windows. While I can't play plague inc I can get down in many EA sports games. That actually look great. This phone plays console like games. I uploaded a fifa 15 image to show just how great gaming is on this phone.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"This is a truly awesome phone. Since my iPhone 3GS can't upgrade to iOS7,I figured it was a time for an upgrade. I considered long and hard before choosing a Windows Phone and I am glad that I did Sure, some apps I was used to having are not yet available, but I find the Windows Phone experience truly superior and this phone is a real gem. The size is just right, even with a nice leather case. It is fast, and fun to use. It paired perfectly with my car and other Bluetooth devices and has met and exceeded my every expectation. Since I generally charge every day, the battery life is perfectly acceptable for my needs. I am very glad that I chose this over an iPhone 5.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"I was amazed how durable this phone is ... I accidentally snagged my skullcandy while going downstairs, and the phone detached, falling bumpety bump ... all the way down. When I got to the first floor, I was surprised that no damage occurred to the Nokia... or even the skull candy!!!",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"Bought this phone due to the fact the seller stated was ""unlocked"", after getting it, came back to Argentina, where I put my local chip and the phone recognized it, no problems so far, then I realized that I was/am not able to use the data connection of my telco, called the company (Telecom Personal) and we did several changes including the configuration of the APN, updated the phone to the latest versión, and the result is: Simply does not work, flashing the OS did not work either. Spent hours trying to solve this problema. Finally realized that AT&T does something to their phones that does not work in Argentina. Unfortunately, I spent more than 200 dollars in a phone that does not work. Has been the worst experience in Amazon since my first purchase years ago. Don't know what can I do now.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"TL: DR: awesome phone, I enjoy WP8 platform, I question how ""new"" this phone was when I received it I really enjoy this phone. For reference I've had an iPhone before making the switch to a Samsung Focus Windows phone, and then replaced that with the Nokia 920. ***The pluses for Windows Phone 8*** + Live tiles are great and give loads of info at a glance. I considered getting a new iPhone or Android phone but the lack of a Live Tile analog killed that idea. I've come to depend on them. Basically each app icon is a tile, occupying space on the main screen. Those tiles display bite sized bits of info so you don't have to open the program to see new info. For example, new emails show the first couple sentences, meeting info shows up on your calendar tile, etc + Great phone for business users - MS Office integration, Live Tiles + Cool xbox live integration + Good social integration if you are into that. A continuous feed of Facebook/Linked in updates in one place + Tile UI is cleaner, more usable than the iphone/android phones I've compared. I liken those UI's to a desktop computer cluttered with shortcut icons. + Separate inboxes for all my email accounts ***The Minuses for Windows Phone 8*** - The marketplace is not nearly as robust as the iPhone or Android market. However if you are like me, you only use 1% of the stuff you download - the important stuff - and that is fully represented on the marketplace. ***Pluses for the Lumia 920*** + Feels sturdy. Looks big and bulky to carry in pocket, but I don't notice it when I do. + Beautiful display. This was a standout for me in the ATT store doing comparisons with other phones. + Stunning night pictures - this aspect of the camera really impressed me. Very high detail photos + Runs fast - apps open fast + Decent battery life. I'm a heavy user and I can usually get away with charging it when I get home at night and having a day's charge the next day. + Gorilla glass prevents most scratches + Good call quality + Speakerphone is pretty good, but volume perhaps a little low + Infinitely better than the Samsung Focus I had. ***Minuses for the Lumia 920*** - The Nokia Drive app (think Google maps navigation) is really hit and miss sometimes. - Day shots with the camera can look blurry on occasion - I never had a protective case - dropped it many times without issue - but one drop smashed the entire display. But like I said, I did not use a protective case. AS FOR THIS SELLER: I have to question how *new* this phone was when I received it. This is actually my second 920 since my cat knocked mine off the table, hitting it just right and smashing the display. I was searching for a way to get a new phone without paying a ridiculous amount of $$$ since I was not ready for upgrade discount. When I pulled the laminate off the screen I noticed a number of very small micro-scratches. A brand new factory-sealed phone would not have these scratches. I wonder if this was a used phone that could pass for new, and then someone cleaned it up for resale. I'm speculating here, but the micro-scratches seem suspicious to me. But I did get this far below what my carrier would charge me. My advice, get the phone, but buyer beware when using this seller.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"This phone is a brick! I've broken many phones over my smart phone career, but not this phone. This windows phone is really easy to use, has awesome contact integration, durable and reliable. This phone runs fast, Windows 8.1 Mobile allows for a wide range of customization, and now with Windows 10 being released it is about to get even better. It comes with tons of free OneDrive storage (~15GB+) and automatically starts syncing all your data (contacts, photos, videos, text messages etc...) to your OneDrive account. The windows mobile key board is hands down the best on the market (just google ""fastest phone keyboard""). Cortana is also included as your personal assistant and she really does look out for you. I'd say this is the best phone for any business or professional. The only stress I've personally experienced was not having Snapchat or my banking apps. The Windows Store app market place is young. There are lots of third party app developers that release apps that mimic big name apps(SnapChat, Tinder etc..), most of these apps allow you to connect to the actual service itself, sometimes these apps can function better than the real thing (Like the old 6-Snap, 6-Tin or 6-Tag etc...), but most of time you just want to be on the same page as everyone else using the official app. However, with Windows 10 mobile, I'm sure that will all soon change. A few months ago I switched to a Galaxy S6 Edge solely because I wanted to have mobile banking apps and Snapchat. I absolutely can't stand my new S6 edge (I have to restart my S6 Edge daily because the OS get's very glitched/slow after a short period of use), it doesn't even come close to Microsoft's careful attention to detail & functionality when developing their mobile OS. I never had any issue with lag on this phone, even after almost completely filling up my storage with photos, documents and apps. I've owned both iPhone and Android devices and this Windows Phone was the icing on the cake. I would prefer to use this phone over my Android any day of the year. There's a lot more to be said, but I would take the time and research if Windows Phone is right for you. I highly recommend this phone based off my experience and I see a bright future for all Windows Phones.

B009ZC91AY,Excellent phone. Very user friendly with a great camera 📷! Very good for professionals as well with some great productivity features.

B009ZC91AY,"There is no perfect phone, but this as close as it gets. As a phone the reception & transmission is very good. As a PDA, its integration with windows, desktop PC, is great. The build quality, like all the Nokia phones I've had in the past, is very good.

B009ZC91AY,"I really enjoyed the 920 however, there were a few features lacking that made me switch back to the iPhone such as custom ringtones for text messages.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,It arrived broken I didn't hear the voice of income calls and I can't repair or return because was a gift for other people which returned to me late,Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,Delivery was within time. Product as per specification except for the earphones which is not provided in the box. Dissapointed due to that. Deliver the Ear phones and I'll be the happiest person :) Thanks,Nokia,"November 25, 2021"

B009ZC91AY,it does not fit the screen size with lumia 920,Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,Purchased this unlocked from this supplier which I also paid for as a new phone and it did not come with the ear phones and is not unlocked. I live in a country which is hard to change all items! Do not buy from this supplier. Phone however is pretty cool.,Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"Look.....You pay for the phone upfront. ATT will not honor a DATA Plan with the Phone unless you have a contract..........they want a 2 year contract now, whether you buy the phone outright or for 19 bucks with plan....This is a ripoff to say the least. The possibility exists to have it unlocked, but your at the mercy of ATT and their senior level management in MAY when the exclusivity contract expires between ATT and Nokia. Leave it alone you guys. If you love ATT, buy the phone and plan for 39.99",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"I have been a fan of the MS devices since the zune, so I am a bit of a fanboy, but I have owned a Galaxy device, and my wife owns an iPhone 4S, so I do have actual comparisons to make. If you are locked into the Apple ecosystem, you may want to stop reading, as there is a sharp difference coming from all Apple products, but if you have an open mind, or are tired of the same junk getting pushed on you from a closed ecosystem, then read on. The OS: MS took the best of a closed ecosystem like Apple's, wherein they control the look of the OS, and the overall functionality and reliability, but took a page from Android, and are letting OEM's create individual hardware to suit different needs/desires. The OS is fluid and fast, there is hardly ever a hang-up, and it just works. I have found no bugs, and I find the structure of the OS to be very intuitive. iOS tend to bury certain settings functions deep within other settings, and can be cumbersome to change, like turning on and off cellular data, which on the iPhone can take a long time, and on the Lumia I can do it in about 2 seconds and then be right into whatever I needed the data for (I switch it on and off a lot because I have a low data plan, just too expensive to pay for data when Wi-Fi is readily available and free in most places I go). The live tiles are fun, and the ability to add just the people I want from my contacts to my start screen and get just their updates keeps me from spending most of my life on Facebook. I can see what they posted, and I don't care much about anyone else, and if I want to post something, it is just a press away. Same with Twitter and many other social services. The ever-scrolling tiles on one screen is much faster and more intuitive than having pages and pages to scroll through, again, makes doing what I want much quicker than on other OS's. MS did their customers a favor by providing semi-regular updates that you don't need to buy a new phone for. I still have an original WP7 device that I use as my work phone (had to drill out the camera and wasn't doing that to my Lumia), and it has received up through the 7.5 update. It is almost 3 years old and works as good as the day I got it, albeit with a more limited app selection since most devs are not making WP7.X compatible apps, and instead are focusing on WP8, but it functions and the experience is similar from 7 to 8. If this were an Android phone, I would have had to root it to upgrade the OS (as I did on my Galaxy S), and in order to stay current, Android OEMs force you into buying a new phone, well before the 2 year cycle of most carriers, which can be expensive and annoying. At least MS tried to keep the ability to update an old phone, but I understand why they chose to change that from WP7 to WP8, a necessary evil. If you have kids, this is the phone for you. The Kid Zone is the best thing for smartphone owners with children: put just the apps and media you want there, and that is all your kids can do. They can't buy stuff, or surf the web, and they can still play games and be entertained. Finally, the OS does not slow down over time like Android does. That was my biggest complaint about my Galaxy S was that after a few months I would have to do a hard-reset and start from scratch, very annoying. The only hard reset I've had to do with a WPx device was to try to fix the screen problem I had that Nokia fixed for me. The Hardware: It is difficult to find a phone that compares to Nokia's upper echelon phones. The build quality is excellent, it holds up to the beatings of my children and random drops, and the camera is top-notch. I would love to have the 1020 for the infinite zoom and 41MP, but the 920 holds its own against just about any other phone out there. The dedicated camera button allows me to quickly snap a photo and not have to fumble around with the phone in order to get the camera going, and if I get a good shot that I want to share, sending to facebook or IM or email is just a swipe to the right away. The sound with and without headphones is great on this phone, although my wife's iPhone 4S seems to be a bit crisper, but it is a great improvement over my old WP7 phone which was inaudible without headphones. Wireless charging... need I say more? I set it down on my bed-side table in the dark, and pick it up when my alarm goes off in the morning without fumbling with wires. The screen is a thing to be seen, especially in bright sunlight. The auto brightness combined with Nokia technology here makes it the envy of most other phones outside during the day. The colors look a bit funny in that super-bright mode, but that shift of brightness and saturation is better than not being able to see the screen at all. Overall, I would recommend this phone to anyone fed up with their current phone. Most people want to dismiss MS as not being able to put out a quality product, and may be turned off by older versions of other MS products (Vista anyone?...), but they hit a home run with this one. Go into a store and play around with the demo model, and then take it for a test drive. Mess around in the settings and read a forum or two to find out everything it can do (took me forever to discover you could turn off Facebook calendars so I stop getting birthday announcements for random people that I friended for various FB games), and give it an honest try.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"Great Phone, in every way ...except one. Battery life. If I was a tenage girl, it might very well be an issue, but I'm not so...it's a great phone. Display is excellent, coverage excellent, sound is excellent Wi-Fi connectivity is excellent. Glass on the face is also excellent. Third Windows phone, and I love it. Buy it. 'nough said.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,The phone itself works but NuTwo doesn't give all the information. They don't tell you that you can't send or receive pictures on text messaging. Other than that the phone works great. Also you can't return it once you buy from NuTwo you own it! Buyers beware!,Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,Received as promised. I had no problems having it activated when I called At&t. It was just as described.,Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,These people are awesome! We had trouble with a phone we bought and they were right on top of it. I have never had customer service this good. My son was on a Army base and set to leave shortly for a new destination. As an MP he needed his phone. Cannot say enough good things about this company!,Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"1 star since the phone stopped working within 4 months. Purchased the phone in Oct'16 and by Feb'17,it stopped working!",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"What Can I say, I am fairly impressed with the latest version of Nokia's offering, its Crisp and there is no lag in the OS whatsoever, the features are endless and I was lucky enough to get a charging pad which does work and I see little difference in wired charging and wireless charging which is just as fast. Another thing the super sensitive screen works with gloves when turned on just as Nokia states, The screen is 4.5 inches and has more pixels per inch than the iPhone 5. As for the camera, it is perfect if you are in a pitch dark surrounding as it captures a lot of details with low levels of light and with even flash off. In other situations it takes better pictures of everything than my digital camera which is about a year old, however I have seen the iPhone 5 photographs on couple of my friends phones and the Nokia has a slight advantage as things are crisper, but it isn't a great difference as the other features, as all phones are getting better camera's. Finally the phone has Nokia's Killer apps for the phone such as Nokia Drive which can tell directions even when off line if you download maps, and Nokia city lens does create a useful augmented reality by pointing out businesses and sights through the phones camera. All of this is only $99 at At&t with a contract and even better only $450 without one, so you definitely get more for your money.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,Is possible download blackberry messenger and wathsapp messenger???,Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"Better than Iphone5 and samsung galaxy4, Better battery and reliable phone from windows. Hats off to lumina 920. Best phone I have ever used.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"The size and weight of this thing is a non-starter for many people.. like most women, and men who wear their phones in a pocket. What a brilliant idea on Nokia's part, to make a ""flagship"" WP8 device that serves the niche market - geeks with large palms.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"Phone delivered on 2/14/2016 and developed unexpected problem on 8/2/2016. Nokia Lumia 920 32GB Unlocked 4G LTE Windows Smartphone w/ PureView Technology 8MP Camera - Black Great phone and appreciate the many features that make it a pocket office. I run a Hotmail, Outlook, Outlook Exchange (Business), OneDrive, Business OneDrive Dropbox and personal Cloud server. A It has a Great Wells Fargo App and can do encryted VPN. Internet sharing is available but blocked by reseller Tracphone. (They want you to buy their Straight Talk WiFi hotspot. Tracphone and StraightTalk same company). This was a replacement for an annoying Android phone that lasted less than a year also. Only real drawback is the lack of applicatons that every Windows Phone user should let their favorite stores or site know are needed. Amazon does not have a Windows phone either and biased toward Android (Goobgle). My only reason for the low rating is the unexpected screen blanking problem. It appears the phone still thinks it is charging or doesn't have enough power for screen. It also only blanks the main screen area and displays the header (signal bars, WiFi, battery level) and bottom navigation keys. My wife liked mine so much she wanted one also. Hers is still working fine. As another customer complained, after the screen times out, neither the double tap wake-up or pressing the power button returns screen. I found that applying power brought screen back and as long as the screen is up there are no isses. Otherwise a four star rating. I will be contacting Nokia on any warranty as phone is needed for work. This is the Breed reseller's, fulfilled by Amazon, response when it comes to warranty: ""Please check with the manufacturer as for any U.S. Warranty is voided. Furthermore, once you purchased your device, you will be given 60 days for a refund and 90 days for an exchange. Any physical or water damages void your warranty with us.""",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"I really like this phone. It is an AT&T phone but I bought it unlocked for TMobile. No issues at all. Some will say that they cannot connect to their MS account (Hotmail, xbox, etc.) but the issue I ran into was that I had 2-step authentication turned on. Once I turned that off the phone synched like a charm. I am hoping to get a couple of years out of it, the only thing that may stop me is if I can't upgrade higher than Windows 8.1. Will research that and see. But for the price of this phone, the quality is EXCELLENT and I would recommend it to anyone who is like me, want good quality but do not want to spend over $200 to get it.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"The seller TURBOTRONICS-USA sold a locked phone as unlocked. I assume the reason for this was to jack the price up. I contacted the seller several times to assist me on trying to get the phone unlocked, and of course no response. I finally had to go on-line and buy and unlocked code for $50,00. I thought that a company like Amazon would screen its re-sellers a little better. My only advise is avoid this seller.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"Needed to replace my original AT&T phone as the flash no longer worked and the charging (micro-usb) port was intermittent. Decided I couldn't wait until the two years was up for a new phone--and I've become accustom to how this phone works--I', NOT an apple person (IBM was my career for 32 years and I won't have an apple product in my home...) I had a very delightful surprise as this phone wasn't black as shown but white--and that's neat. Charged it up overnight, added a screen protector and changed the sim card and everything worked great. No trouble syncing with my existing Bluetooth devices. The only thing wrong this this phone--I mean this brand--is that the vibrate function could stand to be a little more powerful. I'm a person with some additional padding, and that seems to insulate the vibrations when the phone rings...yeah, I know, I could stand to lose a few (perhaps a dozen...) kg. I'm having my original phone repaired--hopefully somewhat less than $100 so we have a spare in our family of FIVE of these phones!",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"I ordered 920 LTE phone-BLACK with paid delivery fee. It arrived fast from SHIPFASTTECH, but I also discovered fast that the phone from this seller could not get LTE. I compare my wife's phone, same model different color, ordered from different seller for lower price and no shipping fee. Hers has LTE signal, and mine doesn't. No matter how I change the settings, update the software or call ATT, 4G is it, an LTE phone with 4G signals only. Just to make the matter clearer, Lumia 920 has two models, one with 4G/LTE and another 4G only. I tried ##3282# for phone Field Test. Initially, it showed nothing, but after multiple phone software updates, it did show something, but still without LTE. Actually, it shows LTE is Invalid and NA in all LTE related fields. As for my wife's 920, it has every parameter/value shown in her phone Field Test results. What has happened to this phone now? I still have it, because it's such a nice phone. It would be perfect only if LTE is available to my phone.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"Do NOT get this phone if you are looking to upgrade to Windows 10, it is incompatible with the OS upgrade. Among my other complaints with this phone I am sorely disappointed and I do not recommend this pos. Update: I have now had this phone for LESS than a month and it broke. It fell from my hand, hit the hardwood floor, and the SIM card popped out! You know, that thing that requires a special KEY to come out? Yeah, that popped out. I even had a case on the phone, but I've already left a sour review on that too before updating this. Just don't get this phone.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"Had a terrific experience with the 928 model; loved it , but this Nokia 920 was a problem from day one. Apparently there were multiple flaws and the T Mobile technician finally said the phone was a dud and there was nothing else he could do.Service on the Lumia is hard to find (""it's so obsolete and it's Windows "") so I finally took his advice and trashed it.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"I love this Phone, I came from Android and used a lot of brand my last phone was the HTC ONE X. I don't like IOS too much so i decided to give Windows Phone a try and it was so much better than i spected. The Nokia Lumia 920 is really fast for all the task. I play games like Aphalt 8, Six Guns, and they run so smooth. The OS make the things better you won't notice any lag on this phone not even on heavy duty. i liked it so much that i've just bought another one. Using WP 8.1 with preview for developers and the only thing that sucks is the battery life but is because the OS is still beta.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"COME ON! With a camera like that- like THAT Nokia, what the hell is the deal with a measly 32GB??? This phone rocks, rocks like a boss - OR WOULD rock like a boss if it had the storage capacity of the modern century. It's ridiculous, if you're an audiophile - like me! And a serious pro photographer - again like me! 32GB will go like yesterdays hot wings. Bottom line if you are like me and make a lot of pics and listen to a ton of photos, this phone can't handle it, not at 32GB. But if you don't have music and wouldn't bother making a lot of great photos with the amazing camera on this phone, then by all means buy it. It is a fantastic device.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"I love this phone. My very slightly out of warranty iPhone went kaput and replacing it while still under ATT contract would have cost me a fortune. The Nokia Lumia 920 is nicer than the iPhone, in my opinion. All the apps I would ever need are included or free at the store. The display is nicer than the iPhone display. Collecting my contacts and storing them in the new phone was painless. The wireless charging with the optional wireless charger is sweet! I come home after work and set my phone on the pad. In less than 30 minutes my phone is fully recharged. The price is right. There is a lot of bang for the buck with this phone.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"Its a Windows phone. If you are looking for all of the popular apps of an iphone then you might be disappointed but as a phone for texting, calling, and some everyday apps it works well. The battery life on it could use some work. Most of the time I have to have the phone in low battery mode to keep the live tiles from draining the battery but I can get a full day out of it. I will probably go for a different kind of phone for my next phone but so far this windows phone has worked well for me.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,I am completely blown away by this phone. More than what I was expecting in a phone. The only thing I am having a bit of an issue with is the music sync. It could be me but I am pretty computer savy so I doubt it. I synced my music to the phone from windows media center and when I try to play a song it says the phone does not play this file format. I checked with the guidelines and the phone support and it says it does. so there is clearly something wrong. Because wmc files are support for this phone. I am sure it will get resolved. I am a huge music lover and I have a large extensive music collection. I would be more than disappointed if this does not get resolved. Needless to say microsoft hit a home run on every other aspect of this phone. It is more like a computer experience than a phone. So .99 percent blown away by this phone. All other applications worked flawlessly. It has online and offline sync you just need to configure it. Both Microsoft and Nokia have downloads for this. Can't express how much I like it simply blown away.,Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,Ordered this ATT unlocked phone to get quick replacement for daughters broken Lumia 920 phone. We both have used this Lumina 920 from ATT for a couple of years and love it. It was easy to back up broken phone and then put her sim card into this unlocked phone and update . Phone arrived quickly . Was glad to find on Amazon as it was not available at ATT store.,Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"My first smart phone.Still figuring it out. Somewhat heavier than friends iphones, but it ""feels"" more durable and is significantly less expensive. I got that Armorsuit Shield thing also cause it seemed to make sense. Time will tell, but so far so good!",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"

B009ZC91AY,"Product match all depends on what you're looking for and for me, this is turning out to be a fantastic product. Handset size is certainly something of choice, depending on how you're planning on using your phone, I was looking for something I could use as a phone/communications/productivity/navigational tool. Pros: -Call quality and signal: excellent so far, even in areas with traditionally poor signal. -Nokia city view: Love it, very handy when I'm traveling and it has an awesome 'interactive' feel to it. -Microsoft office integration: fantastic,syncing through your live account is easy and controlled, you only put what you want onto someone else's server and maintaining that split is easy for both contacts/calendars. OneNote syncing is the same way, again, very controlled and then seamless once you've setup what you're willing to share. -Email: Love the windows 8 tiles (for the phone, I have the opposite feeling for the desktop and I'm ambiguous on the tablet) for separate email accounts, very handy for splitting work/business/priorities since you can control what notifies to your lock screen per tile. -Overall OS feel: again excellent, surprisingly so actually. I was expecting more bugs but this is really polished and slick. -App store: there's enough here to be functional, which is all I wanted ~ although someone really wanting a plethora of games will be disappointed. The nav/prod side is solid though. -The Win7 desktop phone app ~ is really all about syncing your itunes to your windows phone and its AWESOME. Best itunes/win translation I've seen. Its bare bones visually, but recognizes all of your non-DRM content and pulls your playlists and catalog seamlessly from iTunes. -The phone itself: great design, high quality, excellent feel. Camera is fantastic (amateur photog - it won't replace my larger cameras/lenses but I might just dump my point and click for it). -New features: haven't tried out things like smartglass yet, but I'm excited about the queue of features coming out for the windows phone and what it can do as part of the msft platform. -Micro usb: I can't tell you how happy I am they used a common standard as their physical interface/charging port. :) Cons: -Win7 desktop phone app ~ can't sync to your office suite directly, you can upload docs but it wont' handle merges/changes like the online sync does. Given msft's segmentation of their business lines, not surprising but I'd like to see it added at some point. -ATT -Lack of documentation ~ this is annoying. Very poor documentation on W8 phone and google turns up results about the OS, not the phone implementation. The limited manual that comes with the phone runs out real quick for usefulness. I disagree with their naming strategy, when I google the iphone (my family has them) finding the answer is easy, ditto with an ipad or an apple OS problem (have those as well) but with the win8 phone I can't find a good segmented knowledge source just about the phone section of the OS.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"I totally disagree with the person who called this a ""phablet"". Really? Not even close. There are MANY phones out there bigger than this right now. Reviewer must have owned an iPhone 3gs to draw this conclusion. The phone is heavier than most but definitely not a deal breaker. It's still relatively thin and easy to hold. Of all the phones I;ve owned (MANY) and they include iOS, Android and Blackberry devices, this is by far the best one and it isn't even close. Now understand, I'm referring to the overall experience as I'm sure there are devices out there that may beat it in a specific area. For my money though, the Lumia 920 gives the best overall experience in every facet. 1. Screen - very bright and rich display with touch screen that can be used with gloves on or with your fingernails. 2. Camera - best camera I've used on a phone and the Blackberry Bold had some very nice cameras (I've also just come from a Galaxy S3) 3. OS - Say what you will but Microsoft totally got this right. Live Tiles are great. They're refreshing, fun, colorful and just a joy to look at. Oh and the OS is smooth and freaky fast 4. OS - Integration with Windows 8 desktop is excellent out of the box and I'm sure it will get better with time. 5. Office Mobile - This could stand some improvement to make it a little more robust but it works good and I love OneNote. Flawlessly syncs with SkyDrive 6. Voice Recognition - Very surprised at accuracy when dictating text messages. Excellent 7. Maps - GPS has excellent accuracy as well, certainly on par with Google 8. Build Quality - This thing is a beast 9. Music - I'm not a crazy music fiend like some but for me, this is plenty good and also syncs with Windows 8 desktop 10. Apps - While the store may not have as many as Apple and Android, it has more than enough for me. I found almost everything I used with Android/Apple and what I couldn't find, I found suitable replacements 11. Performance - Blows iOS and Android out of the water. I FINALLY found a phone that actually comes close to all the bragging that cell providers do about speeds. This is it and it is the ONLY one I have thought that of. If you're thinking of trying this out after having iOS, Android, or Blackberry, do so with an open mind. It is NOT any of those. It has it's own way of doing things. But as different as it is from Android, it makes up for it in many other ways. As for what I might miss right now, about the only thing that comes to mind is the lack of a notification LED (C'Mon Nokia!) and more customization with notification tones, all things that can be corrected with software updates.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,This is by far the best phone I've ever had. I've owned the Nokia 920 for two years and it's still going strong. I've dropped it countless times and there isn't so much as a scratch. I love the live tiles. It's so easy to use and customize. The only things negative I could say is the app store is limited because many companies don't develop apps for windows phones and there's no possible way to take the battery out in case of an issue.,Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,Dirt cheap phone on my 2nd one now first one the buttons stopped working so I was forced to only use the touch screen was not able to change volume because volume cannot be changed on screen. The alarm clocked randomly stopped working was forced to buy another one I should've bought an android but this phone is so cheap I just bought a 2nd one for 50 dollars. Don't buy these phones I only buy them because I cannot afford anything better on my 3rd windows phone now. They are so dirt cheap though it doesn't matter if they break often. Microsoft will probably stop making these in the near future and not support them anymore.,Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,I like this phone. Then again I am a windows girl. It feels nice on the hand and not bulky at all. I had to replace my lumia 810 which started giving up on me after about a year and half. this phone was the perfect replacement as I couldn't afford to get the lumia 1020 which was the ultimate upgrade idea for me. The phone itself was unlock and made the transition really easy... the only thing that I am still having problem with right now is MMS messaging. It will not send or receive pictures and I am trying to get that worked out with my cell carrier.,Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"To give some background, I have been an iPhone user since the first one was introduced in 2007. I loved my iPhone. It did everything I needed and more. As more and more options came out, I was interested in what else was out there and decided to give this phone a try. LEt me start with the hardware: Pros: -I love the screen size. This is one of the things that attracted me to this phone because I really wanted something bigger and felt that the iPhone 5 really didn't add to the screen size as I had hoped. - I couldn't ask for a better camera, it is awesome. One of the best I have seen in a cell phone. - The feel of the phone. It just feels solid and well constructed. Some phones feel flimsy and cheap, but not this one. Some people don't like this because of the weight, but I don't find it to be that heavy. - Wireless charging built into the device. Cons: - I wish the camera was placed a little differently. It is right in the middle of the phone and I find myself covering the lens when shooting one handed. - It doesn't have expandable memory. I thought this is something everyone used to differentiate themselves from the iPhone. One thing to mention is the battery life. I was lucky if I made it through the day on a single charge when I got the phone. After letting it drain completly and doing a full charge, the battery life has improved greatly. I can now go about two days with no issues. Now the Software. I have to admit that the Windows look and feel is totally different from iPhone or even Android. I find some things to be easier to navigate. I also think that there was some bad choices made that make it less intuitive. This OS also has the feeling of an immature platform. After having been out for two years, I expected a lot more from it. It does not have a lot of the top apps yet. MS is working on this, but it shows. I also feel that there is a lack of quality apps compared to the iPhone apps. ONe of the biggest complaints, as mentioned above, is just the immaturity of the platform. There are certain things that I would consider critical that are just missing. ONe fo the biggest that has plagued me the last few days is playlists in the music app. You can create them on the phone if you use some roundabout set of instructions. Once you do this, there is no way to edit the playlist. You can simply delete it. Also, the app that is used for syncing has absolutely no functionality and cannot handle anything like this. There are other things that pop up like this that make me grumble and check my eligibility for an upgrade. My overall impression is that the hardware is solid. The OS is lacking. All of the issues I have mentioned can be fixed in a SW update, but I will be switching back to my iPhone when I can and dropping this phone.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"

B009ZC91AY,I got this unlocked and it was working fine for a while. I was coming in from using a HTC Titan and I like Windows phone so it went well for a couple of months - until it starting acting weird. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUqH7No88mg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjtreGaaQUA the screen basically gets a mind of its own sometimes and starts selecting/touching stuff on the display by itself. It started out pretty random - was typing a text message and it started to type gibberish. This went on and off for a while - until it completely bricked last night. I used to love Nokia- had a few of them while growing up but this is a huge disappointment. My old HTC Titan ran for 2 years without any major problems..:(,Nokia,"November 25, 2021"

B009ZC91AY,Great cell phone. I really like the tiles that Windows phone has. No complaints. Does what I need it for.,Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"I must preface this review by stating that I am a Nokia employee and all following comments may be tainted by incidental bias. Also coffee. I must also state that I am a button-pusher. All day I push buttons here and there. I push them almost everywhere. I've come to love the button push. I've come to love it very much. I'm not a touchscreen sort of guy. Yet I use touchscreen phones and know not why. I love their look, their feel, their glow. So maybe, after all, I really DO know. The Lumia 920 has been called a brick. ""Excessive length, excessive thick"". It is not featherweight nor thin. Neither plasticky nor crackity nor prone to spin. Yet in my pants it loves to ride. And in women's purses darkly hide. But, oh! the gasps when it's in sight. Sexy lines and colors bright. Some swear there are no apps for it. But owners know they're full of... spit. How many, how much, can you install? There's only so much time, after all. When I gave up keys, at first it hurted. But now I am complete converted. Adjust, adapt, adjust some more! You too can be a touchscreen... connoisseur. So here I sit, a-fondly staring; touching, flicking, swiping, sharing. Enjoying the little live tile show. Feeding my info addiction, you know. I like.",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,Above average.,Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B009ZC91AY,"Beware of this merchant! After several emails, I was informed that the Lumia 920 is locked to AT&T network (still not sure if it is a black color or white one though). If I had purchased the phone before I pressed for more information, I would have surely been dissappointed (they even offered a refund if I had purchased it). Their advertising of this phone is not very clear, and misleading - so be careful! Ask detailed questions BEFORE you purchase from any of these Amazon merchants!",Nokia,"November 25, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"Windows Phone 8 is the best. I have a Windows 8 PC and once I got the Nokia Lumia 822, my Windows 8 experience got better. I can transfer files with ease. With the PlayTo option I can play videos and music to any compatible device, such as my Xbox 360, and watch them on a larger screen. Plus, with 7gb of SkyDrive, I can save my photos, PDF files, etc and view them on any Windows 8 device. It also takes a micro SD card, up to 64gb, so I can store music and videos on my phone as well and save my phone's internal storage for the apps I install on it. I sometimes feel like I'm in Star Trek TNG with the way it all works together. Now when I see Lt. Commander Data with his data pad, I keep looking at it to see if he's on Facebook. Windows 8, Windows 8 RT and Windows Phone 8 is truly TNG. I like the Family Room option a lot, too. My brother and my sister's fiancee also use Windows Phone 8 and, even though my sister's fiancee is on another service provider, we share the Family Room to post pictures, events, and news to each other or just simply keep in touch. To truly appreciate it, you have to try it out.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,3rd phone like this that I got. One eventually broke after countless drops. What did it was a drop at speed from a bike. Still works but the screen has too many cracks now. The other two are still working.,Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"Great phone that has worked out well for me. No problems and easy to receive updates through Windows. Some times have to fiddle around with the charging plug to mark sure it is locked in correctly, but this is a minor problem that from my research is not uncommon for the type of phone. Very pleased.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I needed to get another phone as mine was giving me some problems. I had a Windows phone several years ago and liked it but I had a few issues with it and upgraded to an Android phone. After two android phones I thought I might try a Windows phone again with a much better operating version, Windows 8 or 8.1. I bought this phone as a ""refurbished"" unit. About two weeks after I received it the USB port failed so I had to buy a QI charging back so I could continue to use the phone (I already had a QI charger). I bought a spare battery at the time of Amazon order to make sure I had at least one good battery available. Overall the the phone had been a good buy. I have also changed to a Windows 8.1 computer some the process was a little easier using the similar OS. I follow the Windows 10 news each week, looking forward to a final public release of W10. I am not sure I will make it to the W10 release before I will want or need to upgrade again. I think Microsoft needs to speed up the release if possible. I am sure a lot of people are getting tire of waiting on a new OS, especially in the Windows Phone area. If MS will help developers port apps from Android or iPhone to Windows universal apps, that will be a good selling point for the windows Phone world. So far I am not willing to try the Windows 10 developers preview software mainly because of the broken USB port. The USB port would be needed if I needed to go back to the current 8.1 software. If you want to try Windows 8.1 this is an inexpensive way to get started.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"Update 7/28/2014: Wow. Just wow. I just don't know where to start. I thought I really wanted this phone, coming from Android phones. It's been almost 2 years and I am still not too pleased with it. When I first got the phone last year, I realized many of the apps I'd used on my Androids weren't available yet. I'm not heavily involved with social media, but I did use Facebook, Craigslist, Noom and sometimes Pinterest. Facebook did just this month finally update their MS app, a definite improvement. Initially, there were several similar apps, but either the MS-specific ones weren't well-developed or the more generalized just didn't work well on this phone. I haven't looked lately, so perhaps there have been improvements in the others. My teenager, admittedly more knowledgeable about technology and trends than I am, offered the analogy of how iphone, android and windows phones are respectively analogous to mac, microsoft and linux computer systems. That helped. But at least he was kind enough not to call me clueless. What I like: --Hand-friendly shape and the size of the viewing area --Live tiles-can pin to the start screen any function you regularly use, tiles are easily rearranged to the size /position that best suits your needs; also, the tile colors can be changed from the garish primary colors you usually see in Nokia Windows Phone ads --Fairly simple to navigate your way through the phone/screens --Calendar and other reminders are more useful than with my Droid/google calendar --Camera takes nice images, especially in low light conditions; video is usually pretty good quality, too What I Do Not Like: --The speakers are tinny, atrocious, just terrible. With my previous phones, the sound quality was surprisingly good, which is why I started using them for more than just speakerphone calls. I know most people use headphones for calls and music, but I prefer to listen to music via speakerphone in an arm band or chest pocket when running trails. I'm usually sharing the trail with others on mountain bikes or horses, so having my ears open is just safer. Besides, by having my ears open, I, too, am open, to the possiblity of interacting with other humans around me. And I'm not blaring my music, imposing it on others. Unlike the ubiquitous private phone conversations now being carried on in any public space. --Having to set up another email account to use the phone --Nokia Music was advertised as a data-free way to listen to music, but it shuts down repeatedly and it's fairly limited in its selections anyway, so I stick with Pandora, Spotify, etc. --Many web pages, such as Craigslist and various news and literary sources, for example, do not format properly on this phone. It almost makes me dizzy to have to pan back and forth, after zooming in, to read a news article or Craigslist post, because it doesn't automatically resize when you double-tap the screen, as my old Androids did. Wow. Just wow. Thanks for letting me vent, to those of you who scanned and moved on to the next review. I hope my insight was helpful in some way. Some of us don't buy phones frequently, so we're a little more invested in researching our choices, hearing what others have to say, before we make that committment.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"

B00A7F57EM,This is a great phone so far. I thought I ordered the black model but they sent it in white. I came from palm pre 2 and so far I love the Lumia. I didn't want an iphone I think they're overrated and clunky. Ive seen my sister in laws with the case on it its like half the size of my kindle. I don't carry a purse and don't want to but with something that big it wouldn't fit comfortably in my pocket. Ive had a droid x too I wasn't impressed with call quality with some calls being echoed. It also didn't have a vibrate option for all alerts which was a turn off here. I was tired of the short battery life of my pre 2 so thats already a step up Id say its average as someone else put it but still one day more than I got out of my old phone. The crisp features of the Lumia are great and receiving and or editing MS docs is a no brainer. The music option is great as you can add your favorites to your desktop. Tune in radio and Pandora are already installed. GREAT for me I'm a music person. I noticed you have to shut it down when it doesn't react like it should. Ive had to once in two weeks so no biggie. One thing I did which I think is a great idea is that for $5-6 you can buy a small case for the phone since it has a slick feel to it you might not hold onto it easily. Ive dropped mine a couple times and it hasn't cracked the screen as someone else said. Its still nice and slim too. The bigger screen is a plus from the pre2 but no real keyboard its all about touch with the Lumia. Id given it 5 stars if it had better battery life. I'm not a big gamer but I see the xbox option on the home screen and I'm sure any of the apps not updated will be soon. It was free to me with a Verizon upgrade so that's great too. After using the a couple weeks after writing this I had to order another phone. The OS didn't seem to be working properly and I want a different color.,Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I loved my Nokia Lumia 822 for about 10 months. It started giving me trouble charging. I would have to wiggle the charging plug in the phone until it would start to charge, then be very careful not to touch it until it was finished charging. After a couple of months of that, it stopped charging all together. I searched Amazon for a replacement, since I liked the phone and had a $30 Otterbox for it. It went from being an $80 phone to being like $400. I went to Ebay and found one for $100. I bought that one, Within a couple of months I started having the same problem. It would be nice if Nokia would make a fix for this so I could keep using this phone.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"The phone itself is great. I don't have to reboot because of slowness or lockup. The Battery last long with minor setting changes. Nokia does a great job in creating apps for WP8. In general lack of apps does suck but over this past year I have seen great improvement in apps and in OS updates which improve the phone while not slowing it down. The built is solid over the past year I have drop my phone plenty of time and the screen never cracked or has any scratches. The sides have minor scratches but the screen is what matters. OS is improving, One Note, Office apps and mailbox are great. Bulit is durable Speed is awesome regardless of how many apps you have installed or updating the OS. Size is ideal it isn't the biggest screen nor the smallest but it is the great. Camera is average but the Nokia apps help it a ton. The fact that it is a verizon and nokia phone helps it out for service and nokia apps",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I used to work at Microsoft and I can remember overhearing conversations at lunch where launch teams were laughing at how their new program was going to market with a 33% fail ratio and it was a major part of the applications that come with Windows when you get the full version. So, basically, they considered it a success that only 1 out of 3 attempts to use this software only worked. Imagine if Boeing were to adopt that sort of thinking? It would not be good. So, knowing this, I was skeptical about jumping into line to be one of the first to own a Microsoft Windows Phone. I had been an Android customer primarily for shear economics. The iPhone is a polished elegant product and they have so many great apps. The Apple product sells for so much more than, well, just about everyone else. The Android has some phones that were better than others. Some were real junk and others were very nicely done. My last phone was the Droid Incredible and I thought it lived up to its name really. It never seemed to run out of memory for tons of texts, emails, and photographs. I was pretty heavy into all of that. My phone was an extension of me, as it is with most people these days. I recently had to go 2 weeks without a phone. Can you imagine? I was constantly reaching for my Android to save the day. I wondered how high we were in mountains, I remembered my altitude app and reached for my phone. Oops, not there. I was at a garage sale and trying to communicate with someone from Russia. No worries, I had this great free app that they could speak into and it would tell me aloud what they said now in English, then I could flip the settings in reverse and answer them with confidence, but not this time. My phone was being replaced and in the mail. We jumped in the car to go for a drive and the last couple of minutes of a great old song was playing, so I grabbed my Android to use Shazam which can listen to any song for a few seconds and then tell you the name of the song, the album, the song writer, producer, and singer. It would tell you when it was produced and released, show you photos of the album cover, provide you with a link to the Artist's Webpage, and show you the best prices online and locally, based on the GPS info that your phone already had. But not that day. These smart phones in general are amazing and incredible. Can you imagine the reaction you would get a mere 100 years ago if you popped out an iphone, fully loaded with all of the best apps? They would probably have you burned for worshiping the devil or for witchcraft. The big question has been there since it all began? Should I buy an iPhone or an Android? Well, we weren't even done with that huge debate and now there is a new contender in the ring. The WINDOWS PHONE. It hit the market with all of the pizazz of a damped firecracker on a winter day. Microsoft should be ashamed of such a pathetic introduction to the world. When it was first released they didn't even have a compatible install of something as basic as Instagram. I am having Vista flashbacks, or even Windows 95. Well, it was mine and I had about 10 days to decide if I was going to keep it or send it packing back to Verizon. The lack of applications was really painful and I wondered how long it would be before MS Got it together with their beloved updates that we all detest so much on our computers. They are a necessary evil, but it would be nice if they got a little closer to getting it right to begin with. :) Looking beyond the app issue, I liked the feel of the phone. The screen was large, bright, and very clear. The software was a bit confusing since it really didn't look like anything we had ever seen on anything before. The live tiles seemed odd at first, but after a few days, I began to get it. I learned how to customize the screen and how to determine what is visible in all aspects of the phone's operations. Then there was the smoking gun. This phone had one thing that I personally hadn't had in such a long time that It frankly shocked me. This phone had a Minimum Rated Talk Time of 900 minutes and a Minimum Rated Standby Time of 480 hours or 20 DAYS. That was it for me. This brand new Windows Phone may not have had all of the bells and whistles just yet (apps), but it looked great, worked well, and had the most amazing battery life I had ever seen. It had a slow start, but the latest reviews are indicating that the sales have doubled in the last year alone and that Meanwhile, Apple’s iPhone lost market share in every country reported by Kantar except Australia and Spain. I recently spoke with a Representative at Verizon who advised that the latest word from Microsoft is that they are approving approximately 100 new apps per day. They are adding them as quickly as they can screen and approve them. Its just a matter of time before they not only catch up, but possibly even dominate the market. Step aside iPhone, you may have a serious fight on your hands this time. Review by Jim Bennett, Snohomish , WA",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,I had a windows phone with at&t for about 18 mos. When I moved to Utah the at&t signal was so bad I ended up going to Verizon. When I went to Verizon last summer they had one windows phone which did not seem very good so I bought a Samsung S3. The Samsung is a really solid phone and I like it...However I missed my windows phone so I purchased an 822 on Ebay. I have been using the phone for the past 3 months. I personally like the 822 much better than the S3 because.. The 822 is a bit smaller and it is easier to hold. I get much better battery life Windows phones are infinitely easier to use. I prefer one long page to 5 pages. Fits in my pocket better. I have 4 emails and I can set icons for each on the screen I love the new small/large icon setup. I love the history tab on each contact. I hate having to dig up emails from months ago..flip to the person who sent it and go to history and there it is. You cannot go wrong with either the S3 or the 822. It all comes down to personal preference. One thing I love about Verizon is that you just pop out your sim card and put it in your other phone and your good. You could not do that at at&t when I was with them. I did try my S3 a week ago just to see how the experience was....I was back to my 822 in a few days.,Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"Update 9/22/13: I am on my 4th Lumia 822 and it works perfectly. Not sure if it's because it's a different phone, or if they fixed the underlying issue, but I am now a happy camper! Old review: DON'T buy this phone if you need your phone to stay on. I bought the Nokia Lumia 822 after having another Nokia phone for about 7 years. It was durable and easy to use, and I never had any problems with it. But I've had problems with the 822 since day 1. It randomly shuts itself off and stays off. The first time it happened, I was late for work because the alarm doesn't work if the phone is off. This happens every 2 nights or so. It also happens during the day. One time, it shut off 3 times within a couple of hours. I couldn't power the phone back on except by taking the back off, removing the battery, counting to 10, and then putting the battery back in. Yesterday, I learned that you can also hold the ""volume down"" button at the same time you hold the power button, and you have to hold them both until it powers back on, about 12 seconds. Better than taking the battery out, because when you remove the back of the phone, sometimes several times a day, the back gets loose. I reported the problem immediately to Verizon, and they told me to keep the phone because they were expecting a software update by the end of the following month that would fix it. So I kept it, but when the next month went by and the phone was still not working, I called back to ask what had happened. They said this is a known issue, and they didn't know when it would be fixed. So I asked them to send me a new phone and they agreed to do so, but it was only when we talked about it some more that I found out they were sending me a refurbished phone. I explained that I reported the problem within the 14 day time limit, so I expected a new phone. They said it didn't matter, all they could send me was a refurbished phone. When I got the refurbished ""phone"", they only sent the front half of the phone. You have to use the old battery, SIM card, and phone back. On this phone, we couldn't even get it set up because of error messages, so I returned that the next day. I'm on my third phone now, and it also shuts off. I powered it on for the first time yesterday around noon, and it shut off by 2:00 PM. It shut off last night during the late evening hours, and it shut off again during the night. My recommendations: 1) don't buy this phone, 2) if you get a phone with a problem and Verizon tells you a software update will fix it soon, don't believe them, and 3) if you have ANY problems with a new phone, don't let them talk you into keeping it - return it ASAP and get a new one.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I purchased a grey 822 from the Verizon store on November 9th (sorry, Amazon - couldn't find it on your site). Nonetheless - this phone has some excellent features, and a few nits. Pro: As has been mentioned, the screen is nice. Surprisingly, you can read it outdoors although direct sunlight reduces visibility somewhat. Pro: Real, honest-to-God Microsoft Office applications - not knockoffs. I've even edited Powerpoint presentations on the way to meetings, with no problems. Pro: RF. I have owned cellular phones, both dumb and smart, since 1992. Sometimes the radios are good, and sometimes you can't hold onto a session to save your life. Out of all the smartphones I've used (including Motorola, who normally makes great radios), this has one of the best. I get reception in places my wife's feature phone can't even pick up one RSSI bar and my older iPhone 4 can't get any reception at all. A fine radio. Can't wait to try it out overseas and see how the HSPA radio works! Pro: Bluetooth 3.0. Very good performance with all my BT devices (including my boat's BT navigation equipment). Con: Bluetooth profiles missing. Why, oh why, didn't Nokia include the HID profile? iPhone and the higher-end Android phones have it, and it's really handy to be able to whip out a BT keyboard to edit some documents. Con: So, Microsoft - where the heck is VPN support? This is easily the biggest complaint I have. I NEED VPN support to connect to machines in my office and monitor builds, perform IT support etc. As it is, I have to kludge by with using WiFi connection sharing and hooking through with my laptop, which is slow and lame and uses up my precious GBs. I have heard rumors that MSFT may include it in Apollo+ (or WP8.1 or whatever they're calling it). We'll just have to wait and see, but that was a big mistake, IMHO. Pro: I concur with previous reviewers on the Nokia apps. They are, for the most part, excellent - especially the ""offline map"" mode in the Drive and Maps applications. Tested by driving all over the lower mainland (British Columbia, Canada for those of you who don't know it), in offline mode and never got lost. Con: Another nit is the lack of connection between the Favorites in the Maps application and the Drive application. One would think you could store a Maps fave and have it show up in the Drive app, but no dice. I had to do everything twice. Annoying. Pro: Audio quality, especially over A2DP (stereo Bluetooth) connection. I play through my BT-enabled receiver and it sounds awesome - especially high-quality rips of discs I own. Who needs an iPod or other player anymore? Summary - a little over one month in, I still like this phone very much and find it a lot easier to use than Android and generally smoother flow than Apple's iOS. If any of you are software folks, you'd appreciate that this OS's design seems to have taken a lesson from this book The Inmates Are Running the Asylum - almost all of my most common tasks are very easy to accomplish with very few gestures/keystrokes. All in all, very satisfied with this device.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I've had this phone since mid-November. Windows 8 is very easy to learn and works well. Internet surfing is exceptionally fast, especially when on wifi or 4G. It also seems to be durable, having dropped it twice while standing. Both times the battery and cover flew off but putting it back together it worked fine. I would subtract a half star for thickness and weight if possible. Additionally the screen is bright and clear and the camera works great under most conditions, lacking a bit in low light as most small digital cameras seem to. Battery - twice since I've owned it I've run out of battery during the day after quite a bit of game playing/web surfing so that seems good to me. Haven't experienced any functionality problems. Highly recommend the phone.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I have had this phone since the end of November and have had nothing but problems. The phone always shuts off when it sits too long and reboots. I've also experienced a problem with the volume control. I am a customer of Verizon Wireless, and all they have done is offer a replacement and a factory reset, both of which have done nothing. I was told by tech support that this is a known issue with this phone, but they have no clue when Nokia will be providing a system update for this phone. I do not recommend this phone, especially if you don't have time to sit around and wait for Nokia to fix the issues or to make several calls to Verizon Wireless Customer Care as they provide ZERO service for these issues.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I switched from the HTC Incredible to this phone. I absolutely love it! It is very fast, the free apps (Nokia city lens, free music streaming - with offline play mode, etc.) work wonderfully, it's really easy to customize just about everything, and the layout is very easy on the eyes...I just love it! Pretty sure extended life battery will fit in an Otterbox case. Now for the cons: There are a limited number of apps at the moment. So far - the only app I have not been able to get that I wanted was the Nook app (although it seems like it will be coming any time now). Furthermore - I think the app dev's will come once more people pick up this phone. Battery life on this puppy (without using the battery saver) is about one to two days depending on your usage of the music streaming, etc. Although, I am NOT using the extended life battery - so that would probably significantly improve. TL: DR -- really nice lookin, easy to use phone; not alot of apps right now & battery life can be short. Overall, the pros far outweigh the cons imo.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,I absolutely love this phone!! I had an iPhone 3G and upgraded to this about 3 months ago. I could not be happier!!! It does everything the pricey phones do without the contract and expense! I have service through Straight Talk prepaid and everything is unlimited! I can't understand why people pay so much for a phone and a contract when you can have this one and have it all!,Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I had my 1st Nokia Lumia 822 for less than a year and the thing just stopped charging. Diamond Wireless/Verizon were less than helpful. Verizon sent me a manufacturer refurbished phone and the damned thing stopped charging within a few months. Broken charging ports seem to be a chronic problem with these phones. I ordered an external charger and extra batteries, because I didn't want to go through the trouble of getting another phone after all of my apps and a random assortment of my contacts were lost in the Cloud. Better off with a couple of tin cans and a string.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I picked up the Nokia Lumia 822 last week and so far I absolutely love this phone. Hardware: Overall--outstanding. Rock solid construction--it feels substantial and well-made. Screen--crystal clear, smooth animation, vivid colors. Camera--I'm not a heavy camera user, but in the few pictures I've taken the camera has worked well, even in low light. Phone--During calls, earpiece audio is clear. Folks I am speaking with say I sound much clearer than my previous phone. Size--the right size for me at a 4.3 inch screen. I don't want anything larger than this because it gets too large to fit comfortably in my pocket. Battery Life--good. I keep most of my apps from running in the background and I can get 2 days out of it. Other users who keep more apps running will likely get one day from the battery. Software/Ecosystem: Windows Phone 8 is awesome. The level of integration between the phone OS, Microsoft Office (including Outlook), apps, Facebook etc., and hardware is outstanding. A great example of this is the People Hub. From one live tile, I can access any of my contacts, whether they are contacts through Facebook, Outlook (from work), Skype, or just a regular contact on my phone--they are all in the People Hub. If I pull someone up, I have several options--I can call them, text them, email them, write on their Facebook Wall, call them on Skype, get directions to their house, etc. The phone pulls in all this information automatically from all of its sources (Facebook, Skype, etc.) so I don't have to spend hours assembling the information myself. Rather than opening up a specific app to do a specific thing, all I need to do is pull up my contact in the People Hub. This is a simple example, but it's one of many innovative features on Windows Phone. One final note--the phone is great for work because it has Microsoft Office & Outlook. I can sync Outlook on my phone with my work email server so that I can easily stay on top of things at the office, without having to rely on a third party app written by a no-name company. I can easily edit Office documents on my phone and sync them to SkyDrive so they are immediately available on all my devices (work computer, personal computer, tablet), all integrated into the phone out of the box. The app selection is somewhat limited compared to iOS & Android, but I haven't had any trouble finding most of the stuff I need. I imagine the app selection will continue to improve once Windows 8 has been out for several months. Folks who are skeptical of Windows Phone 8 should just do one thing--give it a try. The more you use it, the more you discover how good it really is.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I was concerned about switching from my Android phone (Samsung Galaxy Nexus). I thought I would miss my apps and the Google ecosystem. I don't. Even though there aren't a lot of apps yet, there are enough to keep you well connected to your community. My whole reason for changing my phone was the bad battery life of the Galaxy Nexus. I was surprises at how much longer the battery lasts in 822, well at least at the beginning. So how long is it lasting? Well I took a trip to Disneyland with the kids... taking lots of pictures, using the theme park app, and checking in on foursquare. The phone outlasted my wife's iPhone 5, lasting 16 hours before I decided to charge it. It still had charge. I don't know if this attributed to the phone or the OS. I really liked Android, but I find Windows Phone 8 to be plain beautiful and simple to use. I have completely converted over WP 8; and there is no looking back. Love this phone.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I just switched to the Nokia 822 from the HTC Trophy. Many in the store were getting the HTC 8X, I think because it seems like a Nokia 920 (only on AT&T for now). I did lots of research on both the 822 and the 8X and I kept coming back to the 822. This phone is wonderful! The screen is so easy on the eyes, everything is so clear. The Camera is very good. The screen response is spot on. The Nokia FREE apps are fabulous (Nokia Drive, Nokia Maps, Nokia City Lens, Nokia Music and more). Not sure if Verizon, MS or Nokia added this, but FINALLY you can change the font size in text/messaging, people, email and more. You can also ""magnify"" the screen. (See ""ease of access"" in the Settings area). The only negative I have found with this phone, is the hard edge where your ear touches the phone. I am already adapting to that.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I wanted a Windows 8 phone, especially after working with my wife's Apple 4s. It's a toy, my opinion. I wanted a smartphone that would work with real world applications and hardware. The interface took some time to master, but it is very versatile. The camera takes get pictures and with the new lens apps they are look professional. There are plenty apps to do whatever someone would need to do.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I bought this phone from another provider & exchanged it the first week due to the camera quit working. Enter the second one where the camera worked for 2 1/2 weeks before failing, so Verizon exchanged it again & the third one failed after 10 days for the same problem camera quit. I spoke to tech for about 25 minutes & they confirmed that the camera was a known & well documented problem & reluctantly agreed to replace it with a upgraded phone.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I read all the reviews and was excited to purchase this phone for my daughter for use on the Verizon 4GLTE Network, normally 3 bars of 4G reception. After 2 weeks we sent it back due to poor battery consumption and exchanged it for a Motorola Razr M. All the nice features and functions are of little use if you have to continually charge the battery even when the phone is barely used and the applications are turned off. Very disappointed in the Nokia 822. My fault for not doing better research and finding the Nokia site with the long list of negative customer feedback about poor battery consumption and the lame excuses and fixes offered up by Nokia such as disabling desirable applications. After 1 week with the Motorola Razr M, my daughter couldn't be more pleased and has none of the battery consumption issues previously experienced with the Nokia 822. Amazon Wireless made the exchange process very easy, however, we did have to pay full price for the RAZR M and Amazon Wireless had it overnighted to us and also picked up the tab for returning the Nokia. Upon return of the Nokia, we were credited for the cost of the RAZR M. Thanks Amazon Wireless!",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,I just purchased this phone about a month ago and it has been nothing but trouble. Now I am having to pull the battery several times a day and reinsert it in order to get it to boot up. It shuts all the way down by itself and won't power up without pulling and reinserting the battery. I called Verizon on it and they told me that they are having this problems on lots of the Lumia 822s and there is supposed to be a software fix coming but they cannot/won't tell me when. Anyone else having this problem?,Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"First of all, I'm not an experienced smart phone user. I have to say the phone is fairly easy to learn and has great features. Unfortunately, after only 5 weeks I dropped the phone and it cracked the glass. I can still use it, but, and here is my problem, there are no parts readily available to get it fixed. Both Nokia and Verizon were unable to help except to direct me to a single repair shop (not local) which would take 5 to 10 days, (not including shipping time) to have fixed. If I could do this over again, I would avoid a phone that isn't this new on the market, especially for someone who needs their phone and can't be without it for 2 weeks.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"WARNING Verizon has altered Windows Phone 8 and requires you to pay $2.99/month for Visual Voicemail. This ends up being a hidden penalty of $71.76 over the two year contract per phone. I have had windows phones on AT&T and T-Mobile and neither charge for Visual Voicemail. If AT&T or T-Mobile coverage is good in your area, I would highly recommend going with them instead of Verizon who alters the phone operating system to stick you with hidden costs. I have two Lumia 822 phones, and enabling Visual Voicemail will cost me $143.52 extra compared to T-Mobile or AT&T. When purchasing the phones I asked the store sales person about Visual Voicemail and he indicated it was free. I called support once I found out it costs and they were of no help. Shame on Verizon, perhaps I should have stuck with AT&T and my Lumia 920. The Lumia 920 was an awesome phone, the only issue was I had poor LTE service at my house.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,Piece of crap phone. I had gotten a new car a brand new 2013 Ford Focus ST and it has issues getting connected to my car.

B00A7F57EM,"The Nokia Lumia 822 from Verizon is an excellent choice for Verizon customers looking to move to a Windows Phone. ASTHETICS I'll start off with the asthetics of this phone. This phone is much more attractive then the photos make it appear to be. PLASTIC - The plastic is sturdy and thick with a high quality fit and finish to it. The black and grey is a flat finish while the white is glossy. It is a plastic with no grip coating and a nice textured look. It does not have the rubbery looking finish as seen on the 8X. For the White glossy finish it however takes a hit in the quality department. The glossy finish gives off a cheap look and feel. It's sad because I was really gunning to get it in white until I saw it. The back cover uses a snap on clip system that hold firmly and does not flex without moderate force. The back cover features NFC but the WIRELESS CHARGING IS NOT INCLUDED. A new cover is required. FEEL - The sides of the phone have and inward slant from bottom to top which makes it comfortable to hold and easy to maintain a firm grip.The phone uses a wider display then you see on other phones. I have big hands and it fits well into them. It feels nice weight wise. It has a little heft to it when holding it but not heavy enough to be bothersome. It feels durable but it a little thick. If you like the iPhone 5 for it's size then this will surely let you down. BUTTONS - The buttons are located on the right side and are thin. They have a firm placement and a nice click to them. The click isn't loud but it makes for an excellent feel. The power button is placed perfectly for your right thumb, I however am left handed and I find it a little more difficult to press.The Photo button is a 2 stage button. It takes a little getting used to as the second stage feels muddy and firmer then the size of the button leads on to be. GLASS - The glass uses an edge to edge front with the exception of the plastic on the bottom portion of the phone. The bezel around the glass is very slight with no gaps. It sports a nice solid black surrounding the display with very responsive touch buttons below. HARDWARE DISPLAY - The display is a 480x800 AMOLED Gorilla glass 2 display. Don't let the resolution fool you though. The screen is bright and the colors pop nicely. I found it to look much better than the 8X display. When the display is turned off or is showing black it blends in with the bezel and looks great. The display sesitivity is great and features an ultra sensitive capacitive touchscreen that works with gloves on although your experience will depend on the gloves. Thicker leather gloves do not work. The touch buttons are just as responsive. PHONE- Phone calls are crystal clear and other callers hear me perfectly. Easily the highest performing phone I've ever owned smartphone wise. The speakerphone is loud and clear as well. The reception on this phone is great as well recieving a reliable signal in even the most problematic areas. CAMERA - This camera is amazing, for the most part. Low light shots come out great with the extreme flash good enough to take a good photo in a blacked out room. it does however suffer from oversaturation and sometimes the white balance just does not work out so well. I think it's more of a software issue and I expect the problems to be resolved in future updates. Nokia exclusive software includes Creative studio for photo editing and Cinemagraph to make animated photos. I took a picure with my daughter moving round in front of a mirror and edited it so she was standing still and just the reflection was moving. Everyone loves it. It outpaces my iphone in every way imaginable. The front camera stays on average grounds however. AUDIO - It features a mono speaker located on the bottom left of the phone. It's really loud but it suffers from a tinny sound. I could hear this thing from across the house though. The earpiece however sounde great and has excellent balance to it. I can hear people even in a noisy room. the headphone jack is on the top right of the phone and features features audio processing from Dolby to include an EQ and ""Dolby Headphone"". Dolby headphone would be best described as the equivelant of the Beats Audio software. It boosts some frequencies and thats about it. It helped out my high ohm headphones out a little bit but is not a replacement for a hardware amplifier. BATTERY - The battery is average and nothing to write home about. I use my phone moderately and it gives me about 16-17 hours on a charge. It stays at the 100% mark for about 2 hours and slowly rolls down hill after that. It is nice having the removable battery though. This includes talking, web surfing, apps, games, photos, texting, ect. MEMORY - 16GB on board memory provides about 12GB of free space after a hard reset is performed (deletes all of the downloaded maps from Nokia Drive). You can then download only the areas you need from Nokia Drive. It also sports an internal SD slot and the battery has to be removed to insert/remove the card. Apps cannot be stored on it. CPU/RAM - This phone has all of the same core hardware specification as every other windows Phone currently available in the U.S. The lower resolution display frees up some memory though and enables the OS to be zippier. SOFTWARE APPLICATION EXCLUSIVES - One thing you get with Nokia is exclusive software. Nokia Drive is not on other handsets yet. It also includes a few extra ""lenses"" (photo apps) such as the aformentioned cinemagraph, Panorama, and smart shoot which takes a series of pictures and then lets you replace peoples faces until you get a shot where everyone is simling. These apps all work great and are fun to play around with. It also includes Creative Studio which is like a photoshop/Instagram filter app. It works well and holds alot of features. Other apps include ESPN, Univision, Words With Friends, Foursquare, Groupon, Nokia City Lens and more. There are currently 32 apps exclusive to Nokia phones on the store as of this writing. OS - Windows phone 8 is a whole new review, I came from the iPhone and I love it. There are enough note worthy apps available to keep me comfortable and the operating system holds enough features to be more then usable on a daily basis. It has it's fall backs but there is nothing to make me run for the hills. I can say that it runs like a champ on this phone. No stuttering, slow loading times, or crashes have happened on this phone. It outpaces my iPhones performance enough to make me go wow. The Verizon exclusive (for now) Data Sense software works great and tracks your data usage and breaks it down to Cellular/Wifi and each app usage and resets whenever you want it to. APP STORE - It's got alot of junk, but if you sift through it there is alot of cool stuff on there. Some things are slim pickings while others have a copy of a copy of a copy. It's no better then android or Apple. There are alot of big name developers announcing new titles every day. OVERALL Overall the phone is fairly attractive, solid, well designed, high quality and very usable. The only design problems I have is the power button being odd for a left hander and the 2nd stage of the camera button just not feeling quite right. The OS is fast, responsive and zippy. The phone works like a champ, The camera is a little quirky but it still is a great camera considering what you have to compete against. It's big and heafty but not quite a brick and I love that. The display is amazzzzzing even though he resolution is a little below current industry standards. Battery is good enough but could be better, I feel like I will get caught with my pants down one of these days. For 100$ you cant go wrong with this phone. It is way better quality then anything else you can find for this price and sets a standard by which every phone in its price range will need to improve to outpace it. If your looking into a windows phone This will surely not disapoint unless you really cant settle for the lower resolution display.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I manage mobile devices for a corporation in Rhode Island, USA and chose the Nokia Lumia 822 when we switched our account over to Verizon. I couldn't be happier. I previously had an HTC HD7 from T-Mobile, and here some some of my observations: - The AMOLED screen on this device is superb and quite possibly one of the best smartphone screens I've ever used. It is made of Gorilla Glass 2 and easily adjusts brightness to ambient light surroundings, keeping the colors sharp and bright whether in sunlight or in a dark room. Don't be turned off by the lower resolution of the 822 - it didn't make any sort of difference to me. Also, it is true that this screen features Nokia's high-sensitivity glass augmentation that allows it to be used with gloves. I can successfully choose music, tap on tiles, and even text without unnecessary effort. - Compared to my 1ghz HD7 running Windows Phone 7, this device is incredibly quick. WP7 was not a laggy operating system by any means, but the 1.5ghz dual-core in this device plus WP8 is a dramatic change. I have experienced absolutely no lag, whether I am switching apps, opening apps (the splash screens for most apps appear for less than a second, even with some video games). Alot of this is due to the OS itself: WP7 was built on Windows CE which had its own hardware and coding limits. WP8 shares the Windows 8 kernel for maximum hardware compatibility and optimization. I'll leave reviews of the actual Phone 8 OS to the rest of the Internet.... but it is elegant, beautiful, fast, capable, and very very under-appreciated in the marketplace. I believe this'll change, and am recommending my company to deploy Windows Phone 8.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I moved to a Lumia 822 Windows Phone after having had a first generation Droid for several years. I was happy with my Droid and it worked well, but after it finally started to degrade it was time to move to a new phone. I decided to try the Windows phone platform for no reason other than wanting something different, and of the options available to me I was most impressed with the Lumia 822. I wish I had made this switch a while ago... The Lumia is a larger phone than my original Droid, and I was a little apprehensive when I bought it because of this. My concern was that it would be bulky and would be cumbersome to use, but this has not been the case. It fits almost perfectly in a pants pocket and it is just the right size when in operation for comfortable talk. It is large enough to allow for talking into the actual receiver instead of relying on the way someone holds the phone which means consistent sound clarity for the person on the other end. Call quality has been great. So far I have had no issues with the ability to speak and be heard in a call. In fact, when switching between speaker phone and regular calling mode the person on the other end has said that they cannot always tell the difference. This was an unexpected bonus - most phones I have used do not work as well as speaker phones. It is important to understand that this phone does not have a standard physical QWERTY keyboard but instead has a virtual keyboard that it displays on the screen. This is becoming the norm anymore, though I personally prefer having a phone that has a physical fly-out keyboard. In use, the keyboard works fairly well though I have occasional issues with tapping the right keys as I have larger fingers which means that sometimes the phone registers the wrong button pressed. This is more the exception than the rule but it happens often enough to merit attention - if you have larger hands, be aware that typing can get a little frustrating if you're in a hurry. The greatest difficulty I have had with this phone is when using it with the car. I have a Ford Focus with full Sync system, and my Droid worked flawlessly with it. The Lumia works almost as well, though I have had the same problem many have had - when making an outbound call the system can shift into privacy mode and no one on either end hears anything. I have found that by using the phone to dial instead of using voice or the dashboard keypad the problem can be completely avoided but this is inconvenient. Recently my phone downloaded a large update and since then it seems to be working more consistently - time will tell if this has truly fixed the issue, but for now I have an acceptable workaround. Now, about Windows 8 on the phone... I am not a huge fan of Windows on the normal (non-touchscreen) computer, but on a touchscreen phone it seems like this is the way a phone should work. The Windows phone OS is very intuitive, easy to use and it just works. I love the tile-based screens. With my Droid I occasionally had issues where I somehow scrolled to a different screen and got icons messed up because of it; I have not had any issues of that kind with the Windows OS and so far am absolutely pleased. The one drawback I have with the platform is that once in a great while the phone will simply reboot without warning - never during a call (so far) but always unexpected. To be fair, I had the same problem with Android at about the same frequency, but it still needs to be mentioned. As at least one other reviewer mentioned, the number of apps in the online store is small compared to the quantity of apps in the Android or iPhone store. So far I have had no problem finding applications to suit my needs. There are more applications being added all the time but the problem is that the market share does not favor the Windows phone. The biggest targets are Android and iOS and that is where the majority of the applications are found right now. There is one application that I have been unable to find that I think is sorely needed - a reputable security suite. As I write this I have found none at all. I have looked at Norton and Kaspersky in particular for applications of this type and they do not support Windows 8 on the phone. To me, this is a big deal. There are partial solutions in the store but so far I have not found an antivirus or anything else that would be termed good mobile security. I do sincerely hope this is corrected soon. This is not a shortcoming of the phone itself; rather, it is a reflection of the Windows 8 mobile market share. The Lumia 822 is not without its quirks and issues but overall it is a very nice phone. It has a good feature set, it is easy to use and it's the right size for me. When it eventually dies, I will likely get something similar.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I LOVE this phone. Have had it for years, no issues. I'm a Windows Phone convert - the OS is smooth, reliable (absolutely zero issues in all the years I've had it), intuitive, and exceptionally easy to use. The Lumia cameras specifically are fantastic - great resolution, and videos are crisp and clear. The Lumia Camera app (free) is definitely worth downloading as well, if you like to adjust ISO/white balance/etc while snapping pics. This thing is so sturdy I stopped putting a case on it, and the screen is STILL pristine, despite dropping it constantly and leaving it in my bag to rattle around with my keys. Only thing I've ever done is replace the battery after several years of battery abuse on my part (I highly recommend buying the OEM version if you do so, got one on Amazon for super cheap and it's been great). It fits nicely in a pocket and your hand, and screen is nice resolution and large enough to view even dense web pages comfortably. Important note - it turns out you can use the Verizon-branded Lumia 822 with ATT, and likely other carriers, by inserting your carrier sim card and simply manually changing the internet APN settings (ATT has an APN settings guide on their support pages for this very reason, others probably do as well). Took about 20 seconds, and voila. Yay! Mentioning this, because I was crushed when I thought I couldn't use this phone after a carrier switch!",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"Basaed on reviews and confidence in Nokia, I switched from a Motorolla Droid 2 Global, which I liked, to the Nokia Lumia 822. Here are some of the main reasons why I am delighted with that decision after having a chance to use the phone: The Lumia 822 camera is excellent; the video and photos are clearer and the lighting more natural than the droid's camera and any smartphone I've seen. The Lumia music features are amazing. Not only can you sink all of you ITunes material with the Lumia device, Nokia provides a free no-add Pandora-like service. Moreover, I've downloaded an app ""Amazing Music,"" which allows you to stream and store quick links to entire albums. Nokia/Lumia's driving and mapping services are rated as the world's best. Though I haven't taken a road trip yet, I tested it with my commute to work, which involves walking and taking the metro: It was incredibly accurate and even told me the stops in between the one I needed. The homepage is incredible. The Windows operating system lets you customize the location and prominence of your apps, and let's you pick a few for live constant updates. For example, when you ""pin"" your contact to the front page (or further down), you see his or her facebook, twitter, or linked-in updates displayed overtop the app. So, you don't even need to log into Facebook to see what your closest friends and family are posting. Indeed, the Facebook and twitter synching is the best I've ever seen. It takes seconds to take a photo, post it on Facebook, and tag your friends. It even remembers your recently used tags. It also shows pictures you were tagged in as a banner as you scroll and read upadates, which you can change if you want. Another plus is that Microsoft office is readily available, so you can edit Word documents and Excel documents, which is very useful for work. It also has a family room app that allows you to sink to-do lists, grocery lists, and anything else across phones and accounts with anyone who has a facebook, hotmail, or MSN account, or wants to create one for free. The keyboard is my only complaint, since I have big thumbs. I moved from the slideout QWERTY from Motorolla to the Iphone-like keyboard here. Still, it is larger, I believe, than the iphone board when you turn it sideways (it has a very wide screen), and the word suggestion tool is very good. I'm getting better at. The app store is a minor issue too, as developers are still getting use to Microsoft's new and impressive operating system (Windows 8). Yet, there are many excellent apps, and almost all of the apps I used with Google's operating system are available (and often look even better), including: Public transit trip planners, Gmail, white noise, chess, YouTube, a photo editor, Wikipedia, Facebook, a flashlight, bike share services, weather channel, a public parking payment app, and The New York Times. For gamers, there are an increible number of options, including Xbox compatibility, but I don't play games other than chess. Overall, these issues are minor. The best part of the phone is its elegance and beauty. The image, picture, and video quality are the best I've ever seen, and the tile colors can be easily changed to your mood or preferences. The conversation and sound quality is also superb. It is easily one of the best phones on the market and is roughly half the price. I highly recommend it.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"The 822 is overall a solid phone. The screen looks great, and while it's not as high of a resolution as some other phones are, it still looks excellent, and video looks really good on it. Call quality is good. The speaker for music isn't that great, but it gets the job done. The phone is built well, and it's survived a few drops. I love the fact that it has a microSD card slot and a removable battery. I have a 64GB card in it with plenty of videos and music on it. Currently you cannot have apps on the microSD, which is a bummer, but not a huge deal. As far as the OS, WP8 is awesome. It's beautiful, super fast, and has a lot of cool things built in. It is currently missing some features, but it is expected that Microsoft will add many wanted features with future updates. The live tiles are awesome, I couldn't imagine a phone without them now. The one thing I do miss is the ability to sync with Zune (WP7 had this ability), which, in my opinion, is the best syncing software out there. Hopefully Microsoft will add the ability back as many people have cried out for its return. So overall the phone is great. I do recommend it, but do know that there aren't as many apps as iOS or Android, though they are getting there, and most popular apps are already available.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"As someone who is very into Andriod, I decided to go out on a limb and try out the Windows OS. I have had this phone for about a year now. I am not going to lie, I am pretty disappointed by the phone and the operating system. but it works alright for what it is. PHONE: I have issues once or twice a week where the phone will shut off unexpectedly. After consistently happening for this long, I was hoping a software update would help fix the issue but it clearly has not. This leads me to believe it is a hardware issue, but the people at Verizon keep telling me it's a software issue and the next update would fix it. As far as durability, this phone is an absolute tank. I have yet to put a case on my phone (living dangerously) and I have dropped it a handful of times. There are some scratches on the corners of the plastic housing, but the screen is in perfect condition. The response time has it's ups and downs. Some times it will be lightning fast, some times it will lag a few seconds. I am always careful to kill all my tasks too. WINDOWS 8 OS: This OS looks sweet. I love the minimalistic layout and the customizability it has. In terms of function, it's kind of limited. Nokia has put out a bunch of really cool apps, like city lens and panorama. The GPS system it comes with is absolutely amazing. It beats all of my friends iPhones and Androids to crap. I would argue it rivals a legitimate GPS system for your car. But in actuality I don't use all of the stock apps to much. The live tile idea is awesome, but it rarely works how it should. They don't load properly until you open the apps, then they will update, which kind of defeats their purpose. The ideas they have going into the OS is great, but they need some optimization. App development is leagues behind Apple and Android. If you're someone who likes a lot of apps, you're going to have to rely on a bunch of 3rd party software. If you're okay with that than go ahead, but I prefer to go with the big developers. It seems like no one really makes quality apps for it. Give it a couple years, i bet it will be fine, but until then I am not going to rave about app availability. OVERALL: I will not be getting another windows phone. I would not really recommend it to anyone else unless you're more business oriented. As a college student I find Android and Apple will better suit my desires. It's not well enough developed for me to really get into it. It was well worth the try, but it's not for me.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I purchased this phone as an emergency backup phone should my primary (Samsung Galaxy Note II) ever need repair or be out of commission. I was able to pick one up off Ebay for roughly $140.00 and it was one of the better investments I have made. Before writing this review I will tell you a little about my tech experience: I've been with verizon for over 8 years, have used IOS, Android (current) and intermittently used Windows Phone Operating System. Each operating system (and ecosystem) has its advantages and disadvantages, as does the manufacturer. Let's begin with what the Nokia Lumia 822 has going for it. Pros: Build Quality-- The Nokia Lumia 822 is exceptionally well made. While thicker than most smartphones currently on the market, this phone feels surprisingly good in the hands. The weight is evenly distributed throughout the body of the phone, and all the necessary buttons (i.e. power, volume, and camera) are located on the right-side for easy one-handed use. The true black display is 4.3"" and is doing a well job of displaying color. This phone is readily viewable outdoors at 75% brightness, and the Gorilla Glass 2 glass panel is very durable (Though I would still recommend a SKINOMI TECH SKIN SCREEN PROTECTOR for added protection). Battery Life-- The Lumia comes with a 2100MHA battery. This is one of the largest OEM standard batteries a manufacturer can put in a phone right out of the box. (For instance, the original galaxy nexus on verizon only came with a 1800, with an extended that pushed 2100). Depending on your use the phone can last a solid 20hours of light-moderate use, and roughly 12-14 hours of heavy use (I define heavy use as video streaming). This is respectable battery duration and let's face it, most people will have a charger in the car, carry an external battery backup etc. Operating System: Windows Phone 8 Operating System is extremely user friendly. You are limited in personalization but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Live-tiles (which are re-sizeable) dominant the viewing screen and like with most functions, a single tap opens the desired program. Unlike other operating systems (i.e. android and IOS phones), windows phone provides you the ability to REMOVE BLOATWARE FROM YOUR DEVICE WITHOUT THE NEED OF ROOTING/JAILBREAKING. This, for me, is a huge plus as rooting a device generally voids your warranting at you run the risk of damaging (bricking) your phone. Manufacturer Support/Investment-- Nokia's suite of apps are simply AMAZING. You get Nokia Map/Drive and Nokia Go-Music. The Nokia Map/Drive is similar to Google Maps and Navigation. The Nokia Go-Music is a FREE music streaming service native on all Nokia smartphones. This app is similar to Pandora but unlike Pandora it is commercial free, you do not need to register, and you are allowed to download approximately ~250songs for offline use. Nokia customer/tech support is also one of the best. GLOBAL ROAMING/UNLOCKED-- One of the primary reasons I bought the lumia is that ALL WINDOWS PHONES FROM NOKIA ARE REGION-FREE SIM UNLOCKED. Meaning, so long as the carrier (other than verizon) produces the cell bands the phone's modem can pick up, you will be able to use the phone on that network. The Lumia 822 CAN BE USED ON T-MOBILE, ATT, ROGERS... and EVEN OVER SEAS. Verizon, a CDMA network, offers very few phones that are unlocked, let alone as capable of being used on GSM networks. So not only is this phone a good back-up phone, it's also a phone which can be used in case you want to switch carriers and don't want to sign a 2year contract/buy a new phone. Cons: Lack of Developer Investment-- The Windows Store has roughly 150,000 apps on the market, as compared to IOS and Google which have over 700,000. The list of apps also grows very slowly in Windows Store-- some of the more popular apps aren't available either. Lack of Mainstream Appeal-- The lack of personalization is a deterrent for some. The live tiles can get boring. >>List will be updated at a later date",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I've had android phones, blackberry phones, and others. The Nokia 822 is by far my favorite. I've never had an issue with this phone and I've had it for about 9 months now. The Windows Phone platform is really cool as far as I'm concerned, and the apps available cover a lot of bases. Do they have as many apps as Android or Iphone? No. Do I care? No. The fact is there is an app for everything I need and want, and there are more being released all the time. The user experience on this phone is so good, my two daughters (ages 15 and 12) both wanted this phone, so they each have one now. They are the only ones in their circle of friends that have a Windows phone. Do they care? No. I think I taught them well. 'Nuff said. Highly recommended!",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"This phone is absolute junk. From the first day I got it from Verizon I've had NOTHING but problems. I've had androids that were better than this useless phone. You would think that if the two greatest tech companies in the world (Nokia and Microsoft) teamed up to make a phone, it would be something of top quality but this isn't the case unfortunately. I've had so many issues with this phone that I had to call Verizon to get a new one..and the new one was EXACTLY the same..im not even going to waste my time calling them again because im so done with verizon and im done with windows phones. These phones are like this straight from the factory because of improper testing by Microsoft, improper testing by Nokia and worst of all...verizon for not intervening when its in their best interest to provide their customers with good phones..because after all....its a telecom company..thats what they do. I am dissapointed with these reviews as well..either they're fake or people just dont know how to review a product or what a review even is. You're supposed to evaluate a product thoroughly before judging it. Everything seems nice when its new but when you have it for more than a year like me then you begin to see why it deserves one single star and nothing more. I came to windows from several androids because I got tired of all the bugs and unreliability that android devices have..also the fact that the phone looked incredibly gorgeous in the store and on YouTube. I can now say this is probably the worst operating system out of all 3 (android, apple, msoft) For crying out loud they dont even have proper apps like a fully functioning browser, a non browser based YouTube app that actually works, a chat app not even a proper video chat app. Everything is garbage.. - phone shuts off at random times once a week - the microphone doesn't function when pressed against your ear and no one can hear you..because for some odd reason the mic is at the earpeace - the back cover is paper thin and the phone is hard to assemble if you need to take the sim out or access the battery compartment - GPS is literally useless unless you want to be taken to a random location you didn't ask for ( happened to me a lot of times) unfortunately nokia thought it was a good idea to block their customers from using the only functioning maps app available..which is google maps..because they have a stupid partnership with windows..so now I have to use a map app that doesn't work - Browser closes by itself..the back button doesn't take you back to the last page you've visited - phone has problems loading images in the browser - problems loading webpages - silent mode isn't silent mode at all, its vibrate mode, loud mode doesn't have the option to turn off vibration - apps close by themselves daily - phone locks up for a few seconds at a time - the app store has probably 1/10th the amount of apps that android does - contact transfer to windows live doesn't work (I've lost so many numbers after I got a replacement for this phone from Verizon - after turning flash off on the camera phone the flash still flashes - highlighting individual words isn't accurate..the phone highlights the complete sentence instead - messages sometimes dont get through - Bing sucks - battery life is really bad - the phone wasn't properly tested - this is my last windows phone On a positive note the phone is extremely rugged. You can probably drop this phone from the first floor of a building and it will still work. This phone is a mess stay away",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I've owned so many phones from all OSes... And this is one of my favorite phones, hands down. Windows Phone 8 has minor, but very nice upgrades over windows phone 7. Most impressive is the hardware. I never owned a Nokia phone, but this one is really nice for the price. The quality and feel are excellent. Highly recommended.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,I've had this phone since 2012 and it's worked flawlessly ... only drawback is that Microsoft won't be updating this model to Windows Mobile 10,Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I switched from an ancient iPhone and could not be more pleased. I was a little unsure the first couple days if I had made the right choice, but I did. I actually use my phone as a phone and I have a hearing impairment. Sound is very good and is this thing ever fast. Only drawbacks I can see is I wish the speakerphone was better and that the battery lasted longer. Try it, you may like it. Mine was particularly appealing as it was free through Best Buy matching WalMart. Update 12/12/12-I really like this phone but the battery just does not cut it. I have everything turned off and it still drains like crazy. I am running a WPBench test on it now and may try and exchange it tomorrow. On my old iPhone 3G with my normal usage it would go 3-4 days. At best, the 822 will go one day. I am hoping this is a defective phone/battery.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I was interested in trying this OS and I keep hearing good reviews, even from the Apple fan-boys. The start screen is fun to watch and it definitely gets attention. So far it is very stable. Not one single lockup or crash. It happened all the time with my Galaxy S. There are only a couple of Apps that I haven't found a substitute for, but something will come along soon.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"My 3-year-old XV6800 smart phone was working fine but so obsolete that I couldn't use Wi-Fi in some locations, so it was time for a change. I spent several months considering my options and settled on the Nokia Windows 8 phone, partly because I'm a Windows user and partly because of the extra-good camera. Over the next two weeks I had a lot of problems with it, mostly software-related, so I traded it in for an Android. Whenever I get a new piece of equipment, I like to start off with the user guide in front of me so I can survey the features and be sure I understand how everything works. The introductory booklet said I could get a user guide by downloading it or by calling Nokia or Verizon . The guide was full of graphics and fancy fonts and choked up my printer so I called first Nokia and then Verizon. Both said that they would not send me a user guide. An obliging Verizon store rep finally printed one for me. I connected the phone to my Windows 7 laptop. It found the phone and gave me a link to download the necessary software. I downloaded it and tried to install it but got the following error message: ""Windows Phone requires Net framework 4.0. Please install from '[...]"" No actual link was given and the address didn't work but I managed to find the necessary page and downloaded the software. After that the laptop recognized the phone but I was not able to set up playlists using either Windows Media Player or Zune and finally gave up on that. I haven't taken the time to tackle this issue on the Android. I'm still using my old phone to play music at the gym. When I tried to get help from Nokia and Verizon they didn't seem to know what to do either. If manufacturers of hospital equipment or kitchen appliances treated their customers this way there would be lawsuits; why do we tolerate this sort of behavior in the case of tech companies? The front screen of the Nokia phone with the flipping tiles was very cute and I loved being able to make a little mini version of my blog page there but these features were not enough to compensate for the hassles. Also, after the withering review by Walter Mossberg in today's Wall Street Journal, I won't be upgrading to Windows 8 anytime soon.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I purchased this phone directly from a Microsoft Store based on many positive reviews. After using the phone for a couple of days, I seriously question whether the reviewers actually use this phone as their primary smartphone. I consider myself an average smartphone user, and based on the Lumia's still lacking features, I have since returned the phone. However, I would highly recommend buying products from a Microsoft Store as they are very helpful answering questions, and have a good return policy. Here are the things that I liked about this phone: * The screen is bright and crisp. * The email and calendar apps have nice features and are easy to use. * The battery life was very good. * Call quality was good. Here are the things that I did not like about the phone: * The Nokia Drive navigation app does not announce street names. It does show the names on the screen, but having to look down at the phone defeats the purpose of using voice enabled navigation. * Many websites do not recognize the phone as a mobile device, so the page is the desktop version. As such, the text does not automatically wrap across the screen. * A widely used podcast/mp3 was not recognized by the phone, so I was unable to download. * There are still quite a few popular apps that are not designed for Windows 8. In summary, if the above items were addressed, I would definitely purchase this phone.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"Although it works it Verizon network, they are altered the WP8 OS in such in way that it's GSM capability cannot be used. It disallows these in GSM mode -Changing APN -Sending SMS (group sms also) (For now, you can downgrade OS to pre portico update & enable these features) Nokia Customer care has said, based on Verizon request, they have disabled these features. And same they will do in upcoming WP8 phones. Verizon said they can restrict customers in whatever way they want. Verizon greed !! Note Microsoft customer care said they will not do anything in this case despite the fact they claim they will control the updates, features in OS",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F57EM,"I love Windows 8, I like this phone, I owned it for less than 24 Hrs when it slipped between my bed and its foot board, as I went to retrieve it, it fell less than 1 foot to the floor and cracked the glass from one side to the other. Not a scratch visible on the phone or a cracked place on the glass. I contacted Nokia customer service and they refused to do anything about it except to tell me to call their service center, since this phone has Gorilla glass, a gentleman commented on my review and advised me of the same, I am now convinced that this phone was defective from the factory, repair will be 143.00. this is un- acceptable , My previous phone was a Galaxy and I dropped it at least a dozen times over the 3 years I owned it, no broken glass ever. I understand glass breaks, Think twice before you buy this phone unless you never drop your phone (LOL). Oh by the way you cannot just replace the glass itself it requires the entire Display unit as it is all one unit so expect to pay big bucks to replace broken glass, Verizon offered this phone for 50 bucks /2year contract, now I understand why. I have to say otherwise it is a great phone but companies must back their products or lose their customers. I have insurance on the phone they will replace for 99.00 which I appreciate but this is really a Nokia Problem and I will never buy another Nokia product because of this.",Nokia,"October 2, 2021"
B00A7F5M9W,"This phone came in yesterday and I was excited. Everything appeared to work fine and fast until I opened up the camera app. Or any app with a camera, like snapchat.

B00A7F5M9W,"This is the most fun phone I have ever had. (I replaced my iPhone 3 with it) I originally ordered the HTC 8x Windows phone but when I went to the store to look at them I compared the HTC 8x and the Nokia 822 side-by-side and chose the Nokia. Holding the two up together, one in each hand, I made the following observations: 1) The screen dimensions appear to be exactly the same 2) The HTC was taller without adding any additional usable screen size. Just extra blank space in each end. 3) The slightly higher screen resolution on the HTC doesn't look any different at all than the Nokia. In fact the Nokia looked better. More vivid, more contrast. 4) The Nokia feels better in my hand. The HTC's tapered edge feels like holding a sheet of glass.. It's not nice to hold in the hand. 5) The Nokia was heavier.. I told the Verizon girl that I wasn't having any trouble lifting it though. hehehe. The slight increase in weight gives you a removable battery! 5) The HTC's screen face was much hotter than the Nokia. It was actually radiating heat. 6) The blue HTC that I ordered looked purple instead of blue. It's too bright of a blue.. looks like a girl's phone to me. 7) The Nokia Drive application does turn-by-turn nav with 3D.. looked better than what HTC had and worked great on my recent trip. And the deal clincher.. 8) the Nokia 822 has Nokia's ""City Lens"" feature. Way cool. When you are looking for a restaurant or gasoline or store.. just point the phone around and it shows you where those things are and how far away they are and in which direction. I love it. I could have also bought the iPhone5 instead but it just didn't excite me at all. More of the same old thing in a taller screen. Yawn. Windows 8 is really cool to use. I think it's going to be a big hit. After my comparison at the store I canceled my HTC 8x order and bought the Nokia 822 on the spot. I'm very glad that I did.",Nokia,"July 7, 2021"
B00A7F5M9W,"To start off, I have to disclose that I bought this from VZW directly and not from Amazon. I should have since it might have saved me $50, but that's OK. I just don't like reviewing things on Verizon's website. Still, the Nokia Lumia 822 is a pretty slick device. I'll break this review down into cons and pros to make it a little more coherent. Let's start with the cons since there are so few. Cons: 1. Screen Resolution- Now I'm not a resolution snob, but moving from an iPhone 4 with a retina display to this gave my eyes a little trouble for the first few hours. The pixel density is lower, so some of the images and apps that run across both platforms lose a bit of visual fidelity in the translation. Still, the 822's color palette mostly makes up for this by producing some of the most vibrant contrast I have seen on a small screen. 2. Iffy body design- I hate to keep comparing this to the iPhone, but that thing had a solid body design. Even with the glass front and back panels, the thing felt substantial and well constructed. The 822 feels like it is made out of lightweight plastic, because it is. The phone feels nice to hold, and it doesn't weigh as much as you would think, but it lacks some of the rigidity that I like in a phone. I've used a number of different smart phones over the years (blackberries, Android devices, iPhones), and most of them felt solid, but the Nokia just falls short here. Every time the phone vibrates, the housing rattles just a tad too much for my liking. The side buttons are a little bit too flat against the phone for my fingers as well, and they feel spongy when pressed unlike the tactile feedback of the volume keys on the iPhone. 3. Strange reception issues- I'm not sure if this is a 4G thing or not, but this phone has trouble getting more than two or three bars of reception at my house, and all of my past phones would pull either full or just under full reception. I haven't had the chance to test this thing out in lower reception areas, but not getting good results at home is a bit concerning. All calls and data tests have been favorable so far, so maybe the indicator is subjective. Time will tell. Pros: 1. Super Intuitive interface- If anyone is looking for a change from the mundane Apple interface, then Windows 8 phone is the way to go. Everything from the initial setup of the phone, to customizing the arrangement of tiles is exceptionally simple and easy to follow. There isn't much in the way of bloatware on the phone out of the box, but there were a few programs that I chose to delete. I would suggest going to the marketplace right off the bat to download many of the Nokia apps that are available though. Several of them serve to enhance the camera software which is pretty basic from the start. The new functions will be worthwhile. Setting up multiple emails is extremely easy, and the integration of my Xbox live account, I can use the Lumia 822 to control my Xbox 360 or transfer music and pictures across platforms! Everything about the Windows 8 interface works well on a mobile platform. The only thing I don't like is that I would rather use Google search than Bing, but I can always use the browser for that. 2. Speedy Processor- My iPhone 4 feels like a bit of a slug now after using this thing for a day or two. I know the iPhone 5 now has a better processor, but nothing else feels different enough about that phone to make me want to stick with the brand for another 2 years. I 822 offers the same functionality of more expensive devices, and the Nokia apps sweeten the deal even more. I loaded up the Nokia City Glass app yesterday, and in the blink of an eye the device pulled up information about my surrounding area. I never got any mapping tools to work so well on my iPhone 4 or my wife's 4s. The 822 might not have Siri, but I don't need it with how well everything flows together on the Lumia. 3. Solid battery life- Phones perform so many functions these days that it's hard to remember that I probably only charged my phone once every two or three days back before I had a smart phone. Still, when a phone is able to go a full ten hours on a stock charge while I'm fiddling around with getting it set up and playing with apps and so on, it gets my endorsement. It's true that it would be best to charge the 822 every night, but there are battery saver settings for those of you who don't use the phone all day like I do. The standby time on this phone isn't setting any modern records, but it's good enough. Still better than that HTC incredible I used 2 years ago. That, and as long as you back out of programs properly instead of hitting the home button, they shut down automatically without having to run a task manager/killer. Overall, the Nokia Lumia 822 is a great value for the price. It keeps up with more expensive devices quite capably, and offers several features that it's HTC 8x cousin does not which made my choice just a little easier. The 822 is not without its flaws, but for someone looking to change things up a bit, this phone definitely hits all the right notes. Windows 8 doesn't disappoint. Update: One week in, and I'm still liking this device pretty well even if some of the initial new phone excitement has worn off. There are just a few more things that I have uncovered over the course of the last week that I would like to point out. The first has to do with the app store, but I'm not here to complain about the lack of content. I know that it will take a little time for the app library to grow enough to satisfy most early adopters, but that's not why I bring it up. In fact, my issue is primarily with just one app that came preloaded on the phone which is Nokia Music. The program works in much the same way as Pandora or Spotify, and it gives you the ability to choose genres of music or specific artists to choose mix radio lists for easy access. The only problem is that if you choose a specific artist so that you can hear similar artists the program doesn't add tracks by your original artist to the rotation. I listened for around 3 hours the one day without hearing a single song from the artist that I used to start the search. Maybe this is just an issue with how I am using the program, but I haven't been able to work it any other way. It's not a game breaking flaw, but it's puzzling. On the up side, there is a Google search app now for Windows that I use instead of the Bing search programmed into the phone. Bing isn't bad, but I don't like the way the search results are displayed. Google is what I'm used to. Another thing that I was initially concerned about was photo quality after so many others had raved about the 8 MP camera on the 822 before I purchased it. Most photos taken with the camera will look pretty so so on the phones screen which is a bit off putting, but once they are transferred to a PC, they really look much better. It's a bit puzzling why such a nice camera was paired with a standard definition screen when the display is not capable of showcasing the image quality properly, but it's not that big of a deal. All in all, still loving the Lumia 822. Update 2: 02/06/2013 After two months carrying the Lumia 822, not much has changed regarding my initial opinions about the phone, but I will say that the general phone boredom that comes with having a phone for a while may be setting in somewhat early with this one. It has nothing to do with the interface or with the basic smartphone functions, but more to do with the lack of any substantial app support for Windows phones. I know I originally said that a lack of apps wasn't that big of an issue, but even though the Nokia apps are pretty rock solid and the Windows 8 OS is great, I want to expand my experience in ways that the relatively empty app store won't allow. I'm not talking about games or ringtones or productivity tools, but rather the lack of some of the more basic multimedia and social networking apps that Apple and Android phones have been offering since they launched. For example, there has yet to be a solid Facebook application built for Windows Mobile OS that works as well or has the level of functionality that other OS platforms have. The free Facebook apps that ARE available allow you to view status updates, post pics, or like and comment on posts, but every time you back out of a post, you are bounced back up to the top of the feed. How frustrating. Also absent are many of the streaming web radio apps like Spotify and Pandora. At least the Nokia phones have the Nokia Music platform, but as I have discussed earlier, they are a poor substitute for more time tested programs. Not having these smartphone staples hasn't broken my experience with the Lumia 822 yet, and there may be some hope for the platform once they earn more developer support, but it's not clear when or if that will actually happen. I really like the Windows 8 mobile OS, but it may be difficult to stick with that option when it comes time to upgrade. Hopefully Microsoft steps up their game, or Apple and Android offer a more compelling alternative by then.",Nokia,"July 7, 2021"
B00A7F5M9W,"For some reason the usb cable goes faulty easily, I bought so many USB cables, and the same thing goes with the earphones. I liked windows phone 8 at some point, but the lack of apps and support were a drawback. I even bought wireless back cover and wiresless charger, few months and died. It was a horrible experience. I won't trust microsoft after this experience.",Nokia,"July 7, 2021"
B00A7F5M9W,"I've had the opportunity to use this phone over the last couple weeks and I have to say that I am blown away by how convenient this OS is! Let me get this out of the way first so you know where I'm coming from: I have built and troubleshot PCs since Windows 3 all the way through 8 and Linux/Unix/Ubuntu, owned and used (and rooted) phones and tablets using the Android OS from the original Droid through the Galaxy S3, Droid DNA, and Galaxy Note 2, and have used (but didn't like; don't hate me) the iPhone OS from 4 through 5 as well as Mac OS, and I use anywhere from 50 - 150 GBs a month on my months plans. All that to say I am not your average user and I am not a ""light"" or ""simple"" or ""easy"" user. And I frakkin LOVE this phone! How is it better than Android? -I love the integration of all the social networking with the people live tile. If you touch People and slide right you'll get all the status updates on your favorite people in your phone book, Facebook, Twitter, Linked In. If you set up a live tile for your special someone, like I did with my wife, I got live updates everytime she posted something and the tile changed background pics based on her uploaded photos at Facebook. So just looking at that tile on my screen I see everything they are doing. -I love the ease and lack of clutter of the live tiles. On Android I often end up with 3-7 screens full of widgets and icons (and in Ice Cream Sandwich folders) and I still feel like I can't find anything. The app drawer gets messy as well because everything get's dumped in there. In Windows Phone, you pick your favorite tiles and put them where you want. I put the games, Xbox, ESPN fantasy football, and NFL Mobile all the way at the bottom so I just scrolled really fast to the end and got to my favorite non-functionality apps. I left my email accounts (all five) up towards the top with my calendar, texts and so on. It was just a relief to know where things were. I can still access all my apps by merely swiping the home screen right. -I love the Data Sense. It automatically compresses data, switches to WiFi, and helps save data usage. This is great for those who are on a limited plan. -I love the Kid's Corner, where you set up apps for your kids, swipe right from the lock screen and only the apps you gave permission for your kids to run are available. Unlike Android or Apple where they still have access to all your apps (and email, calendar, etc) but can't buy things if you set up a PIN or lock, with this your kids never even see those apps. -I LOVE the integration with Xbox. As a long time Live member I love that if you play a game on this phone (even the free Minesweeper and Breeze) you get acheivements on your Xbox Live. You can also use your phone to control your Xbox 360 (with Smartglass, which is available on Android as well) and see your avatar, buy clothes, see your friends and last games/ apps run, etc. This integration is amazing and gives Windows Phone a killer app that they would be wise to play up. -Integration with Office and SkyDrive. SkyDrive is amazing anyway, but with free Office built in you use real Word, Excel, PowerPoint in phone with edit. -Xbox Games. You heard me right. There are some versions of Xbox games available in the app store. Civilization Revolution (the only Civ game on any mobile phone OS), Plants v Zombies, Carcassone, Final Fantasy, etc. (If you had cross platform ownership this would be THE selling point for gamers.) Why is this phone better than the 8X? -Nokia Apps. Nokia has a suite of apps that they developed exclusively for their Nokia phones (8X has more powerful specs but is built by HTC), like Drive+ (turn by turn directions,) music, city lense, and they even developed Draw Something for this device. -This phone feels more substantial and real than the 8X. The 8X feels like a tall iPod, with that ultra light, soft plastic cover that rounds from flat on the back. It is also a great phone, but this one feels hefty, solid and looks great in white. How is Android better than Windows Phone? -Apps. Windows is missing some of the apps that I use the most. Some app developers are MIA completely as of this review (like Google) but have indy developers making apps that work (like Gooroovster, GDocs, gMaps, GoVoice which are indy versions of Music, Docs, Maps, Voice.) But I'm still missing Voxer, Dropbox, most of the games, and a bunch of productivity. -Lack of keyboard options. Those who don't use Swype will not care about this and will actually like the auto correct, which is much better than the normal keyboards that come stock. But Swype lovers (or Flex T9) lovers like me will balk at having to peck away one key at a time. -I don't like having to pay for apps on Windows Phone that I already purchased in Xbox Live, especially since the apps are called Xbox Live apps. Why pay for Plants v Zombies on this phone when I already paid for it on Android and Xbox Live? This is a great phone, at an amazing price. It feels like Android did a couple years ago when we were waiting for all the apps. Once they get here this will be a great alternative for gamers, productivity/business users, and casual users/iPhone users wanting an alternative to Apple's high prices. Great phone!",Nokia,"July 7, 2021"
B00A7F5M9W,I now use the HTC but had Nokia for a couple years. The camera doesn't zoom and its thicker than the HTC. The battery will come out of the Nokia. The HTC on the other hand is a bit longer but its thin. Had to get an aftermarket battery for the Lumia. The battery doesn't come out of the HTC. They both have similar features so you don't have to learn to use both. They're both the same in alot of ways. The Nokia 922 is a Nice backup phone.,Nokia,"July 7, 2021"
B00A7F5M9W,"what a great experience. love this phone. really fast, great display and feels great in my hand. I enjoy the window os. MSFT did a great job with the social connectivity and ease of use.",Nokia,"July 7, 2021"
B00A7F5M9W,"Don't buy this phone, it's incredibly unreliable and the software is glitchy. Problems: -- Bad software where you are constantly and inexplicably being dropped out of applications to go back to the home screen. -- Poor wireless connectivity, often applications will say you have no internet or cell service when you in fact do. --Usb connector on the bottom is s***, most attempts to plug in do not actually charge your battery. Usually you need to spend 1-3 minutes fiddling around with the usb cord to get the battery charging icon and then sometimes it still randomly stops charging -- Phone randomly turns off. Yes, for no reason, your phone will just turn off and you need to turn it back on. -- After less than 4 months the phone is dead. Yes, dead, never to return. A true piece of s***. Summary: A true piece of s*** phone. Not worth your cash or the blood, sweat and tears of the factory workers churning out this garbage.",Nokia,"July 7, 2021"
B00A7F5M9W,"my wife got this phone a couple of weeks ago because her friend had just picked it up. they both have been having trouble with this phone, as of today, this will be the 10th time i had to take out the battery to reset phone. First day no one received texts, remove battery. Next receiving double or triple text, remove battery. Now phone is frozen, remove battery. we have not added any apps to the phone, we have updated the phone(software) since. not worth the headache.",Nokia,"July 7, 2021"
B00A7F5M9W,Love it.,Nokia,"July 7, 2021"

B00A7F5M9W,Phone is top notch!,Nokia,"July 7, 2021"
B00A7F5M9W,"This is a great device, which I found to really exceed the reviews and attention it has received. I was originally hoping to get the Nokia 920, but it was not offered by Verizon. After a careful review of the specs between these two phones, I came to find that they are virtually identical with 4 main differences. 822 has over the 920: Removable battery (very important for me as I use my phone for tracking long bike rides and hikes using GPS and need to replace the battery) and Expandable Memory using a micro SD card. 920 has over 822: Improved screen (not really that noticeable side by side), image stabilization in the camera optics. This phone does everything I want. The NFC (Near Field Communications) is great for sharing photos and contacts with a friend. Its very fast and snappy, and the Microsoft Windows 8 software really impressed me. Everything (settings, photos, videos, etc) syncs to my private web storage on Skydrive, so when I take a photo, I can easily access it via the web site. The integrated Microsoft office is also really a nice feature. This phone is a great combo of quality hardware and well designed software. I'm really pleased with my switch from Android to Windows Phone 8.",Nokia,"July 7, 2021"
B00A7F5M9W,"Bought ""used"" off eBay. Got a sim from the Verizon store and activation was easy. This phone feels great in my hand. Bought an extra battery for $40. I bought a wireless charging plate and back for my phone for about $70. 25% off when you order over the phone instead of an in store purchase. Feels heavy and solid with the wireless charging back on. 32 gigabyte SD card. All that money an I still dropped it from 3-6 feet about five or six times. No broken anything so far. Thank God. Downloaded Nokia maps for the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Love Nokia drive. Great directions and I don't have to worry about a cellphone connection. This is especially useful in California. Windows 8 is incredibly smooth. Customizable tiles are awesome. I shut off the ability of all apps that I have power over from running in the background. My battery life is 1 1/2 - 2 days without charging or battery change on a conservative to moderate usage. Checking emails, making calls, short game play. Overall I love and recommend this phone. What I don't like about it is the camera. My HTC Trophy took better pictures. Sad. Camera is slow too. For a phone that is free with contract it's a steal. Even with the crappy camera. this phone became glitchy and started freezing and crashing as of 4/13. this is why i left android. i'm going to try apple",Nokia,"July 7, 2021"
B00A7F5M9W,"When I first heard about this phone, I was rather curious about how good the phone itself would be. Microsoft had been advertising the new Windows Phone 8 for a while and for a bit, I was divided between this phone and the HTC 8X. What really convinced me to buy this phone was its price. But when I started using it, I started to like this phone even more. HARDWARE: This phone has 16 GB of memory with 1 GB of RAM and a Qualcomm Snapdragon dual core processor. Unlike the HTC 8X and even the Lumia 920, this phone has a Micro SD slot to expand its overall storage which is a real bonus for me. It features a screen with a 480 x 800 resolution. Despite the low resolution, the screen quality is excellent with bright and vivid colors. To be honest, you won't notice much distortion of text except in small fonts on web pages, but that can be fixed by pinch-finger zooming. SOFTWARE: It features the Windows Phone 8 operating system. However, Nokia's windows phones all feature Nokia apps which are a real blessing since without the apps, the phone would lack a voice navigation app. The Live tile feature is also quite useful for checking things quickly. For instance, I can use the calender app's live tile to see my to-do list for the day without having to open the app itself. CAMERA: The phone features both an 8 megapixel camera on the back of the phone and a 1.2 megapixel camera on the front. The quality of pictures from the front camera leave something to be desired, but most people will rarely ever use the front camera aside from taking pictures of themselves. The back camera on the other hand has superb quality and is also capable of recording video in 1080p. The camera has a couple issues related to the software, but that should eventually be fixed with a couple of updates. BATTERY: For me, the battery life was excellent. I was messing around on the web watching videos, listening to the music and just web surfing in general. The battery lasted around 11 hours despite the workload I put on the phone's processor. I can easily assume that the battery will last much longer when the phone is on standby. Turning off NFC (Near Field Communication) will help increase the battery life further. CARRIER: Verizon overall has been an excellent service for me. I've had Verizon phones since I was 16 years old and I never want to stop. The people at the Verizon stores are always friendly to me and I rarely ever find a spot without reception. For those of you who hate Verizon, but still want a windows phone, consider the Lumia 920 that's AT&T exclusive. CALLS: The phone has exceptional call quality with a microphone that picks up my voice with exceptional clarity while I can easily hear what the person on the other end is saying with my speaker. It can be a bit loud for some, but adjusting your speaker volume will easily fix that. APPS: The App store has some good apps, but is overshadowed large number of 'junk' apps, but that may have to do with the fact that there aren't enough good developers creating apps for Windows Phones yet. However, I believe that in time as more people buy Windows phones, developers will take their time and begin developing more excellent apps in the future. OVERALL: I must tip my hat to Nokia for creating such an excellent phone at such an excellent price. Nokia has always had a reputation of creating durable phones that last a long time. I will easily recommend this phone to anyone and everyone who is thinking about buying a new phone. You can't get a better phone for $99.99. Period! Update: I'm seeing this phone available for $0.01 on Amazon. I thought a price of $99.99 was worth it so getting it for $0.01 is a steal! Update #2 (March 4, 2013): Three months later, I still like this phone. I've found that it syncs nicely with Windows 8 on my laptop and my Surface Pro with Office, SkyDrive, and its calender.",Nokia,"July 7, 2021"
B00A7F5M9W,"The Nokia Lumia 822 from Verizon is an excellent choice for Verizon customers looking to move to a Windows Phone. ASTHETICS I'll start off with the asthetics of this phone. This phone is much more attractive then the photos make it appear to be. PLASTIC - The plastic is sturdy and thick. The White glossy finish takes a hit in the quality department. The glossy finish gives off kind of a cheap look and feel. I feel the matte black and grey looks and feels much much better. It's sad because I was really gunning to get it in white until I saw it. The back cover uses a snap on clip system that hold firmly and does not flex without moderate force. The back cover features NFC but the WIRELESS CHARGING IS NOT INCLUDED. A new cover is required. FEEL - The sides of the phone have and inward slant from bottom to top which makes it comfortable to hold and easy to maintain a firm grip.The phone uses a wider display then you see on other phones. I have big hands and it fits well into them. It feels nice weight wise. It has a little heft to it when holding it but not heavy enough to be bothersome. It feels durable but it a little thick. If you like the iPhone 5 for it's size then this will surely let you down. BUTTONS - The buttons are located on the right side and are thin. They have a firm placement and a nice click to them. The click isn't loud but it makes for an excellent feel. The power button is placed perfectly for your right thumb, I however am left handed and I find it a little more difficult to press.The Photo button is a 2 stage button. It takes a little getting used to as the second stage feels muddy and firmer then the size of the button leads on to be. GLASS - The glass uses an edge to edge front with the exception of the plastic on the bottom portion of the phone. The bezel around the glass is very slight with no gaps. It sports a nice solid black surrounding the display with very responsive touch buttons below. HARDWARE DISPLAY - The display is a 480x800 AMOLED Gorilla glass 2 display. Don't let the resolution fool you though. The screen is bright and the colors pop nicely. I found it to look much better than the 8X display. When the display is turned off or is showing black it blends in with the bezel and looks great. The display sesitivity is great and features an ultra sensitive capacitive touchscreen that works with gloves on although your experience will depend on the gloves. Thicker leather gloves do not work. The touch buttons are just as responsive. PHONE- Phone calls are crystal clear and other callers hear me perfectly. Easily the highest performing phone I've ever owned smartphone wise. The speakerphone is loud and clear as well. The reception on this phone is great as well recieving a reliable signal in even the most problematic areas. CAMERA - This camera is amazing, for the most part. Low light shots come out great with the extreme flash good enough to take a good photo in a blacked out room. it does however suffer from oversaturation and sometimes the white balance just does not work out so well. I think it's more of a software issue and I expect the problems to be resolved in future updates. Nokia exclusive software includes Creative studio for photo editing and Cinemagraph to make animated photos. I took a picure with my daughter moving round in front of a mirror and edited it so she was standing still and just the reflection was moving. Everyone loves it. It outpaces my iphone in every way imaginable. The front camera stays on average grounds however. AUDIO - It features a mono speaker located on the bottom left of the phone. It's really loud but it suffers from a tinny sound. I could hear this thing from across the house though. The earpiece however sounde great and has excellent balance to it. I can hear people even in a noisy room. the headphone jack is on the top right of the phone and features features audio processing from Dolby to include an EQ and ""Dolby Headphone"". Dolby headphone would be best described as the equivelant of the Beats Audio software. It boosts some frequencies and thats about it. It helped out my high ohm headphones out a little bit but is not a replacement for a hardware amplifier. BATTERY - The battery is average and nothing to write home about. I use my phone moderately and it gives me about 16-17 hours on a charge. It stays at the 100% mark for about 2 hours and slowly rolls down hill after that. It is nice having the removable battery though. This includes talking, web surfing, apps, games, photos, texting, ect. MEMORY - 16GB on board memory provides about 12GB of free space after a hard reset is performed (deletes all of the downloaded maps from Nokia Drive). You can then download only the areas you need from Nokia Drive. It also sports an internal SD slot and the battery has to be removed to insert/remove the card. Apps cannot be stored on it. CPU/RAM - This phone has all of the same core hardware specification as every other windows Phone currently available in the U.S. The lower resolution display frees up some memory though and enables the OS to be zippier. SOFTWARE APPLICATION EXCLUSIVES - One thing you get with Nokia is exclusive software. Nokia Drive is not on other handsets yet. It also includes a few extra ""lenses"" (photo apps) such as the aformentioned cinemagraph, Panorama, and smart shoot which takes a series of pictures and then lets you replace peoples faces until you get a shot where everyone is simling. These apps all work great and are fun to play around with. It also includes Creative Studio which is like a photoshop/Instagram filter app. It works well and holds alot of features. Other apps include ESPN, Univision, Words With Friends, Foursquare, Groupon, Nokia City Lens and more. There are currently 32 apps exclusive to Nokia phones on the store as of this writing. OS - Windows phone 8 is a whole new review, I came from the iPhone and I love it. There are enough note worthy apps available to keep me comfortable and the operating system holds enough features to be more then usable on a daily basis. It has it's fall backs but there is nothing to make me run for the hills. I can say that it runs like a champ on this phone. No stuttering, slow loading times, or crashes have happened on this phone. It outpaces my iPhones performance enough to make me go wow. The Verizon exclusive (for now) Data Sense software works great and tracks your data usage and breaks it down to Cellular/Wifi and each app usage and resets whenever you want it to. APP STORE - It's got alot of junk, but if you sift through it there is alot of cool stuff on there. Some things are slim pickings while others have a copy of a copy of a copy. It's no better then android or Apple. There are alot of big name developers announcing new titles every day. OVERALL Overall the phone is fairly attractive, solid, well designed, high quality and very usable. The only design problems I have is the power button being odd for a left hander and the 2nd stage of the camera button just not feeling quite right. The OS is fast, responsive and zippy. The phone works like a champ, The camera is a little quirky but it still is a great camera considering what you have to compete against. It's big and heafty but not quite a brick and I love that. The display is amazzzzzing even though he resolution is a little below current industry standards. Battery is good enough but could be better, I feel like I will get caught with my pants down one of these days. For 100$ you cant go wrong with this phone. It is way better quality then anything else you can find for this price and sets a standard by which every phone in its price range will need to improve to outpace it. If your looking into a windows phone This will surely not disapoint unless you really cant settle for the lower resolution display.",Nokia,"July 7, 2021"
B00A7F5M9W,I upgraded to this phone coming from the Moto Droid X2 back in March of 2013 and all I can say is that I will never go back to Android. The software is fluid and the phone is top notch. You will not be disappointed with Windows Phone 8 and Nokia. Blazing fast and a head turner this phone has it all.,Nokia,"July 7, 2021"

B00ACZ0DUA,"This is such a fantastic phone. Microsoft is crazy to abandon the Windows Phone OS and Nokia phones!! I had an Android phone, and UGH.. its OS is clearly put together by committee. Windows is flawless.. and the Auto-Suggest feature is FAR superior to Android! So smooth, so accurate, so quick.. and the keyboard is a joy to operate - much less mistakes. The Nokia is a superb quality phone. This is a solid jewel.. beautiful perfect size to fit the hand - not too large like the ""phablets."" This has the feel of an ultra-luxury item. I get my two home emails and my work email on it now, so convenient. The browser is quick and responsive. The screen is just beautiful. I love the rich colors and sharp contrast. I love the text-to-voice on Bluetooth in the car. I'm amazed that this will serve as a mobile hot spot, too! This phone has the best camera I've ever had in a phone - the Zeiss optics and image stabilization give superb results - sharp, accurate, saturated colors with excellent contrast. The good macro operation is a nice surprise. Comes with 32Gb of resident memory, plenty for almost anything, easy to offload if it fills up, so no need to buy an extra memory card. I love this phone. LOVE it. It came unlocked, as advertised, works great with T-Mobile. Sound is better than my Android phone, signal reception is better. I'm stunned that you can get this much phone for $100. Buy this while you can!! Microsoft: PLEASE re-commit to your Windows Phone OS!! Nokia: OMG, the quality of your phones is so outstanding - PLEASE keep making them! I love being able to buy something so nice.. and NOT made in China! This is manufactured in Finland. How refreshing. I can't say enough about this phone.",Nokia,"April 22, 2021"
B00ACZ0DUA,"I really wanted to like this phone. The most amazing thing about it is the camera, the pics are awesome. However, the phone malfunctions often. I've have it less than four months and I've had to restart it many times, has notification problems, wi-fi is another issue and the list goes on and on. I would not buy this phone again or recommend it to another person. I am not sure if I got a faulty phone or if this phone is pure junk.

B00ACZ0DUA,"The descriptions states: RM-820 4G Network LTE 800 / 900 / 1800 / 2100 / 2600. It DOES NOT WORK ON 2600!!! I travel a LOT for business and bought this phone to be able to contact clients and keep updated on emails and whatsapp. I travel to Brazil frequently and it DOES NOT WORK ON LOCAL 4G networks. I tried to update it and be able to set maximum speed to 3G (which shoukd work) but it does not allow me this option (blocked by ATT). FRUSTRATING as it states a 4G 2600 network and does not allow the user to set max speed to 3G (tha would work). RESULT: cannot use it in BRAZIL and other countries!!! wasted money...can anyone help??? MERCHANT: can you offer me a solution??? PLEAAASEEEE!!!! Otherwise, I love the phone!!",Nokia,"April 22, 2021"
B00ACZ0DUA,"The Phone works perfectly on T-Mobile's 4G Network. And with T-Mobile's simple plans, you save a significant amount of money as compared to a 2 year AT&T contract. The device doesn't have any carrier markings on it, and comes with a non-US charger, but they also send a US-compatible socket adapter, so there are no problems there. There is nothing on the product or packaging that indicates country of origin, but I'm assuming Malaysia since that was what was default when I booted up the phone.",Nokia,"April 22, 2021"
B00ACZ0DUA,Love the features!! Love the Camera. User Friendly. Battery Life could be a little better and the App store doesn't have as many Apps as iTunes or Android. But the phone is great if you are not someone who is all about the Apps. Talk to Text feature is spot on. Better than iPhones (I previously had an iPhone). Pros: Ease of use User friendly interface Camera and Camera Features and Camera Apps Talk to Text Feature Cons: Battery Life - Not really a Con unless you will be using your phone for a long time during the day. Not as many apps as iPhone or Android Overall I love this phone and would highly recommend it.,Nokia,"April 22, 2021"
B00ACZ0DUA,"Overall is a great phone, I am huge Windows OS fan. Was able to upgrade to 8.1 immediately which was a huge plus. However, on the first day the phone locked up and had to hard reboot it.

B00ACZ0DUA,"I am an blackberry and android user. I picked up this 920 as a spare phone, and the price couldnt be beat. This phone is built like a brick. Its heavy and solid. The Camera is top notch. its Blows my 20mp Sony Xperia Z3 even though my phone is 3 years newer then this one. The phone is rather quick, and it takes no time to learn how to use it. Its really great to know that Nokia is going to be updating this phone to windows 10. Apple makes you buy a new handset to get the newest features. If only windows apps where as abundant as android id make the switch. all in all im very happy with my purchase. an easy 5 star rating",Nokia,"April 22, 2021"
B00ACZ0DUA,Love my phone it's very fast and works perfectly camera is very good,Nokia,"April 22, 2021"
B00ACZ0DUA,"I would like to share my experience with this transaction. Received the phone promptly, beautiful little thing, that my daughter loved to play with. Windows applications for it may not be as plentiful as on Android, but they work surprisingly well. No issues. 6 months later the phone just hung. I have given CPR to Windows phones before, and saved two Nokia's that way (using Microsoft recommended recovery tool) but this time , it was not to be. I contacted the seller expecting a drawn out process, but was pleasantly surprised to receive a prompt response and a fair resolution. Highly recommend the product and the seller!",Nokia,"April 22, 2021"
B00ACZ0DUA,"My Third Windows phone and my second Lumia. I went with the 920 even though it has been around for a while, because I wanted to buy a cheap non-contract phone(this one is locked to ATT) and not get tied to ridiculous monthly ""Next Plans"" or extra fees for a two year contract renewal. The 920 has WP *8 and will support the 8.1 upgrade so i am waiting to install that. But I must say the job from WP7.8 (Lumia 900) to the 920 and WP8 is worth the price. Nokia Transfer My Data App was great for bringing over all my old SMS messages. Rest of Windows phone transfer is easy just sign into accounts and everything is there. Phone arrived new in ATT packaging (sealed), it is locked to ATT and fine that is who I use, sim card popped in and worked no issues have all my services and LTE data worked fine. Added the DT-900 wireless charge and an otterbox Commuter case works great and charges through the case.",Nokia,"April 22, 2021"
B00ACZ0DUA,"Iam very dissapointed with this device. only windows phone 8,",Nokia,"April 22, 2021"
B00ACZ0DUA,"I couldn't download any apps when I first got it, So I reset it and that corrected that issue. I also have issues w/wifi connections (but that could be self inflicted. But I will say that it seems like a great OS and I'd definitely recommend it .... :-)",Nokia,"April 22, 2021"
B00ACZ0DUA,"Had to purchase another one... Speakers stop working, Microsoft said it was out of warranty... Its cool, its like rolling dice sometimes...",Nokia,"April 22, 2021"

B00ACZ0DUA,"All very good, excellent seller, thanks.",Nokia,"April 22, 2021"
B00ACZ0DUA,Not really what I wanted. I like my Lumia 640 better. It had some things that I liked.,Nokia,"April 22, 2021"
B00ACZ0DUA,Received phone in great shape. Everything on it seemed to work well. Went to an AT&T store to get it activated. The phone wouldn't handle the SIM card and wouldn't connect to ATT. Asked for a refund/exchange. Refund approved quickly. Received personal Emil with apology. Good customer support.,Nokia,"April 22, 2021"

B00ACZ0DUA,"The first time we ordered this, audio was not working properly. The caller sounds like the person is in a tunnel but audio is perfectly fine when using a speakerphone.

B00ACZ0DUA,Windows Phone just keeps getting better with 8 and now the release of 8.1 dev preview (which i installed on it after purchasing). The hardware is awesome and wireless charging is very convenient. Takes good pictures too. This was a replacement for another 920 I had that the screen had cracked after dropping it on hardwood floor (about the 15th time dropping it so it was due for breaking).,Nokia,"April 22, 2021"

B00ACZ0DUA,"Android? aka Google? Watching, recording, keeping notes on every call, text, email and making money off you in ad's? Google's moto ""used"" to be don't be evil. That is certainly NOT the case any more. Don't like NSA? Thank Google. Owned one before getting the 1020 with crazy camera. AMAZING phone. Great Photos. Windows 8 is rock solid reliable. And I have used IPhone and Android native email apps and touchdown on both Apple/Android and Windows 8 default email is FAR superior. I still own the Galaxy S4, used to have S2. S2 is superior to S4 imo. Seemed much easier to use. Still W8 phone beats both S2 and S4. S4 is just stupid with feature creep overkill. So in conclusion: W8 Lumia 920, EZ to use W8 Lumia 920, Screen is amazing, Gorilla Glass sooo durable, viewable in full sunlight(try that S4..not happening) I DO NOT use screen protectors and lay this phone screen down with a PECK Candy Shell case all the time, will not slide off my dash with the PECK case. W8 Lumia 920, Pictures are stunning. W8 Lumia 920, Ultra reliable operating system, will not crash(again S4....crashed all the time) W8 Lumia 920, Corporate business email soooooo much better on this phone. Regular email like yahoo, gmail, etc. works fine on this phone. Unlike androids hodge podge of email apps and each one works different. W8 Lumia 920, ONLY phone to buy is a W8 phone, ultra reliable highest quality handset.",Nokia,"April 22, 2021"
B00ACZ0DUA,"The OS is now on par with others and beyond in some cases. I'm glad Microsoft finally put all the effort into a product to make it superb. The phone has a nice display and good battery. Mine easily lasts the day with some music playing, lots of texting, email and news checking. Speakers a good for a phone and the buttons are nicely placed. Easy to hit but don't snap when you pocket it. Overall size is perfect. I'm 6 Ft and wear a large glove. My wife actually has the bigger 928 and she loves the size. I think the old moniker might apply. Once you go..... bigger, you never go back.",Nokia,"April 22, 2021"
B00ACZ0DUA,"Windows Phone 8 is great. Nokia Lumia 920 is also great, except for the fact that it's not a phone, it's a phablet, so it won't work for most people.",Nokia,"April 22, 2021"
B00ACZ0DUA,"The phone is beautiful and looks better in person than on the picture! I am a Nokia lover, started using Nokia's in college and feel in love with the brand, consistency and easy to follow features. I've tried Samsung a couple times, just not as satisfied. I've heard different things about Nokia, some say ""Microsoft bought them,"" or the phone is being ""discontinued."" I picked the Nokia Lumia 920 for the features, style and color and big nod to the Carl Weiss camera optics, this is my fifth Nokia phone. I highly recommend Nokia, it will always be my phone of choice.",Nokia,"April 22, 2021"
B00ACZ0DUA,"This is a wonderful step up from my Nokia 520. I originally had the budget AT&T Nokia 520 on the gophone plan. I got this phone new and in the AT&T box from phone zone. Delivery was faster than was expected. I received it 3 days earlier than the projected receiving period. Popped my gophone sim in and works great. This phone is even better with the windows phone 8.1 dev preview. (WARNING: any associated warranties with your phone could be lost if you install the developer preview on your phone). If you are looking for a reliable phone that does not cost 500 to 600 dollars, this would be a good choice. The only downside I do not like with the phone( and it isn't even the phone) is the limited apps and games availability on the store. But I don't really play any games on my phone anyway so to me it does not matter.",Nokia,"April 22, 2021"
B00ACZ0DUA,"The phone that I got from the particular seller that I got it from, Amazing 1980 with the description ""very good"" (not at all, seemed like an old phone with little glitches at first). It started going bad about a month after I got it. Apparently there is no give on the 30 days that I had never paid attention to as I've been buying on Amazon for a good long while and never had to return anything. I did read the reviews of the phone and the seller and decided to get this one. Of course an older model, so you need to be okay with that and I was. I don’t need a fancy phone and I prefer the Windows phone. But this phone started getting too hot while charging, dying before my alarm goes off, even though its half to fully charged before I go to sleep and then freezing up, not responding to my touch for any reason, for several hours until it dies and then it's okay once I start charging it again, not until it's turned itself off though. Random, and too often, texts never make it to my boyfriend or children, etc or I don't recieve theirs. I've had it for 6 weeks and it doesn't look as if I'll be able to get a replacement or refund. I don't recommend this phone (although that could just be this phone) as I love the windows phones but I don't recommend that seller for sure.",Nokia,"April 22, 2021"
B00ACZ0DUA,"Unless you are a Canadian customer with a SIM for Rogers communications (Canadian phone company), I cannot recommend buying this phone. While my US SIM activates the telephone service and I am sporadically able to make calls, any time I use data, such as text, MMS or internet, the connection is reset as there are bad settings that home to DNS servers in Canada (which reject the requests because I am not a rogers customer). The Nokia AccessPoint application - downloadable from the store while connected to wifi) fixes some of the issues, but I still cannot use MMS features and the connection regularly resets when I am sending text messages.",Nokia,"April 22, 2021"
B00ACZ0DUA,Good phone for simple task. But My husband's only lasted about 4-5 months. Needs repair for he gets the same emails multiple times and slower.,Nokia,"April 22, 2021"

B00ACZ0DUA,"This is a very nice true 4G/LTE phone. Good grip, feels solid in my hand. Vivid yellow body with green screen background (a little variation from what's shown on the picture) makes the phone look very stylish. Although apps may not be as many as other types of phone, but for basic needs and available essential apps, this phone is definitely entitled a 5 starts.",Nokia,"April 22, 2021"
B00ACZ0DUA,"This phone was actually for my kid, as I have had mine since January of 2013, and still love it. The Windows ecosystem is a huge factor in what makes the device great, being able to sync to your computer with SkyDrive and OneNote. Bing apps such as Bing Sports is a great all-in-one sports app, much like Bing News is for world and local news. All the Nokia apps in the HERE family (navigation, etc) are outstanding and their Nokia Music app let's you download hours of offline 'radio.' The once-upon-a-time lackluster app store is more and more flush all the time, although to be honest I never really saw a shortage of quality apps. As to the shipper and the actual device shipped, it is exactly as offered, brand-new in the box and on schedule. The software has been updated since the phone was released so it does take a bit to bring it up to speed, but that is really a non-issue.",Nokia,"April 22, 2021"
B00ACZ0DUA,Great,Nokia,"April 22, 2021"
B00ACZ0DUA,"Had a big scare with this phone, which is why I am taking 1 star off. When I turned it on all I could see was a red screen with a white Nokia logo at the top. Being new to WP8 I waited, and waited, did some research online, to no avail, did a soft reset, a hard reset. Nothing but a red screen. Had to go the Nokia website to download the Recovery Program, which for some reason was hard to install, run and make it work on my Windows 8 laptop (at first would not let me install it because W8 thought it was suspicious... doesn't Microsoft own Nokia now??, then the program wouldn't find the phone, then the download would stop after a few seconds or minutes but eventually finished - WAY TOO HARD!), but eventually I was able to re-install the OS and it started. Been working fine since then. Coming from years as an iPhone owner, there are some good and some less good. And WP 8.1 is coming so that should make things better. I am missing some apps but found some decent new ones. Battery is better than on my iPhone 5. Battery saver is useful, so is the ability to block some apps from running in the background. Screen is gorgeous, but that phone is a brick. Geesh, it's heavy. No case on that one! Dedicated phone button works well to wake up the phone and take a pic, but that process is far from quick, takes a few seconds. I have AT&T by the way. Was able to sync music from iTunes on my Mac (only non-DRM songs). Some odd things. Be prepared to enter your microsoft password a gazillion times - annoying. Phone numbers have to be entered with a +1 to be recognized by sms app, and the mail app doesn't like large inboxes. Coming from an iPhone 5 this is fast enough. Charging takes longer.",Nokia,"April 22, 2021"

I tried a soft and hard reset, cleaned it, and tried many other suggestions from the internet. Nothing worked. While looking for solutions, I came across many posts with people stating the same problem with this phone. I am very disappointed. I love Windows phones and I don't want to use any other OS.

B00ACZ0DUA,"This PARTICULAR phone (the 920) will NOT take Windows 10. So don't expect it. Buyers Beware, the apps for ANY and ALL windows phones is SO limited as to make their phones a flippin JOKE. App for that? ..they aint got it. you will be able to visit FB and Twitter, but if you want an app that is USEFUL to you LOCALLY, like for say your Library, almost any store, Schools, Taxis, Buses, Airports... FORGET about it, aint gonna happen. I don't care what version it is, because you can not do half the things other phones can do, probably not even a quarter! I have just about stomped on mine I'm so frustrated with NEVER being able to grab an app I'm needing. If you just want something portable so you can keep track of FB postings you'll be good with this, oh and you can get the weather! Yes the phone works, looks pretty, looks like a smart phone, you can fill it up with pretty pictures, but WINDOWS failed to realize that a ""smart phone"" that can't grab an APP, and does not offer their version of an app, is not so bloomin smart. Evidently when they failed to dazzle the market they decided to take their anger out on their buyers and deprive them of anything truly useful. Friggin windows... THIS is why you see so many of these phone for sale at what ""seems"" a reasonable price. This was my 2nd windows phone, I had the 520 before, but this will be my last.

B00B2BYU1Q,"Too many people write poor ""Product"" reviews based on sales experience. I agree that it totally sucks to order a new or refurbished phone only to receive one that appears to be used, doesn't work right, is not unlocked, is in a foreign language, etc. HOWEVER, PLEASE DON'T KNOCK THE PRODUCT WHEN THE THIRD-PARTY SELLER IS THE PROBLEM! There is a separate place on Amazon for rating the third-party sellers: http://smile.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=537774 Even though this page is listing a NEW phone for $179, be sure to check all options on all colors. It changes constantly. There is currently a new yellow version on this site with prime shipping for $149. If you don't mind buying used or refurbished, there are some great deals to be had if you are patient. I am very satisfied with $115 for a phone that is the same as new. I ordered from CELLULAR GALLERY and could not be happier! My phone is a factory refurbished (not seller refurbished) unit. It was in the original AT&T box with the original packaging and paperwork. I'd swear it was brand new rather than a refurbished unit. It was so inexpensive ($115.00) that I was hesitant to order for fear of a rip-off. I have had it for two weeks. It looks and works great! No issues at all. It is a fabulous phone with an incredibly bright screen and a really good camera with a Carl Zeiss lens, f/2.0 aperture and optical image stabilization. Still shots and video are really excellent quality and I'm pretty picky. I generally use a dedicated camera (Sony RX100-iii) for photos and video. The phone looks great and feels solid. It has second generation Corning Gorilla Glass and a very accurate digitizer touch screen. It is a pleasure to use. My previous phone was a similar sized older LG Android phone. The screen on that phone was dull and washed out compared to this one. It was also much harder to scroll. This phone almost anticipates your moves. The automatic screen flipping works instantly in any direction. The on-screen keyboard is accurate and responsive. I ordered the phone unlocked and I use it on the Straighttalk network. I'm not a huge data user, so their inexpensive all-inclusive monthly plan is a great price for me. I have good coverage in my area for the towers that Straighttalk shares, so that's never an issue. I am pleased with both outgoing and incoming call quality. I understand that the Nokia Windows phone is out of date, but I don't care. I was tired of my old Android phone but did not want to pony up for the cost of an iPhone. They are wonderful, but dreadfully over-priced. Since I'm not a Microsoft basher, I was curious to see what it would be like to use the Windows 8.1 operating system. I like it really well. It doesn't have the app-support that iphone does, but it has what I need, so I'm more than satisfied. The screen on this phone will knock your socks off. It is as good as the best iphone I've ever used. The previous Lumia 900 used an AMOLED display which people raved about. This Lumia 920 uses an IPS LCD screen. The debate will forever rage between the two technologies; IPS LCD for more vibrant black/white sharpness, AMOLED for more natural color progression. The best Android phones use AMOLED. All of the iPhones use IPS LCD. Either one is the best screen technology today and may just come down to personal preference. I am loving the display on my Lumia 920. I can see it outside in bright sunlight better than any phone I've previously owned. I hope this proves useful to you if you are considering a Windows Phone. The Lumia 920 is a really terrific one!",Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00B2BYU1Q,"The internet reviews for this phone looked really good and so as my Blackberry was dying I decided to purchase one. Firstly it did not arrive by the guaranteed shipping date. It arrived 5 days later. I originally had it shipped to a friend's house but because it arrived 5 days late, he had left the country. So we had to convince the FedEx guy to allow the neighbour to sign for it then ship it to a new address, which had an additional cost attached to it. When I finally got the phone and opened it up, the manual was missing from the box - maybe it was a used phone. When I finally loaded my SIM card and made the first call I realized the microphone was not working. Anyone interested in purchasing this phone, search for forums about ""microphone not working in Lumia 920"" on the internet. Unfortunately I did not pick up on this earlier, the microphone has a noise reduction feature which sometimes cancels out your voice completely so the person on the other end does not hear you at all. Sure it works fine on speaker and videocam because that uses a different microphone. Apparently it is a design flaw in the Lumia 920 and Nokia doesn't seem to be doing anything about it. All those fancy features yet the basic thing a phone is supposed to be able to do is allow you to make and receive calls and the Lumia 920 is incapable of doing that. What a waste of money! Disappointed!",Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00B2BYU1Q,"I have to admit that most people I talk to have never used, seen or attempted to understand a Windows Phone. Usually when I demo the phone, the response is one of surprise, how nice it looks and how easy it is to use. It's intuitive. I love how I can open my documents, whether they're Word, Excel, PowerPoint. I can use Skype for personal and business video calls and virtual meetings. It interacts with Facebook so all my contacts there automatically populate to the phone and it sets itself up. I can manage my email accounts (I have 3: business, personal and a 3rd party organization) easily from the home screen. My calendar is plainly visible from the home screen as well. When an appointment is coming up, the phone's personal assistant, Cortana, will automatically check road conditions and advise me when it's time to leave, if traffic conditions dictate. The apps are the only issue with this great phone, however I don't use that many apps. I can still research products, scan barcodes, listen to music, purchase music over the internet, view videos and much more. I love this phone and would like to see what improvements the upcoming Lumia 950 will have.",Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00B2BYU1Q,"I am not new to this phone, I had to get this one as a replacement for another 920 of mine that got stolen. First I am gonna just put my original device review here, then get into this particular posting. April 27, 2013: The phone's review will have to incorporate bits from the OS too, so let's be done with that first. Live Tile remains one of the best interface innovation on any platform, the addition of a smaller size of tile makes thing only better. Ability to change tile size of any app depending on user's priority is simply brilliant. Nokia Windows Phones come with access to Nokia's full suite of mapping apps, although they are now available to others also, Nokia stays on top of the game by providing other exclusive apps like Nokia Music, Cinematograph, Storage Manager etc. Offline mapping data is a godsend. Added capability of apps' to integrate to lock screen to quickly provide you with info you care about the most is also awesome. The added accessibility tools like changeable font size, UI zoom, high contrast mode(looks freaking gorgeous) makes the OS the best choice for people who needs any of them. The usual goodies are of course still there. Onto the device itself. The screen size is 4.5"", which in my opinion is the perfect size, not too small, not too big. The high PPI screen is a joy to use. It retains Lumia 900's slightly squarer 15:9 aspect ratio, and the increased PPI makes it one of the best display in the market. The curved display's edge meets the rest of the body flawlessly, making the phone a joy to hold. The poly-carbonate's texture is simply luxurious. The material also means that color won't come off even if scratched. Nokia has used a new kind of coating on the logo, and the three capacitive keys that makes it really easy to see them even when the back-light is off. Slightly raised position of the keys is also a very welcome change, makes it very hard to accidentally hit them now. The camera is hands off the best phone-camera out there, nothing more to say there. Although the from camera is less than stellar. A few issues that still remain is that I want the headphone port at bottom and the micro-USB port on top of the device, it has it in opposite order, although to be fair every OEM is guilty of this offense, except only Apple is now putting headphone port at bottom. At least we get a camera button with windows phones. The phone is indeed a little heavy. 900 is my opinion had the perfect weight. While 920 has better ergonomics, I find it a little heavier than I would have like. But given the built quality, OIS camera, display quality, 32GB storage etc. being a little heavy is easy to forget. Present, 05/22/2014: First let's talk about the software. Windows Phone itself has gone through several updates, three small ones (General Distribution Release, or GDR 1,2,3), and a huge one, Windows Phone 8.1. The phone I received came with GDR 1 installed. So being the enthusiast that I am, the first thing I did was upgrade all the way to WP8.1 developer preview. One very good thing about Windows Phone is you don't have to stay in the mercy of your operator, and wait months for an update. iPhone users do not suffer from it, but this issue plagues Android users to this day. A very important addition along with GDR 2 was Glance Screen, a Nokia only feature, that allows you to see your notification without turning on the display. After the last update it shows time, notification, and your next calendar appointment. Coolest feature ever. WP8.1 brings some much needed and requested addition to the platform. 1. Cortana. If you've played you are familiar with the name. Microsoft really wants to achieve similar thing here, and they've already succeeded to great extent here. Voice recognition specially is uncannily accurate, even for a non-native English speaker as me. 2. Notification center. Windows Phone has lagged in this aspect. But it's finally here, and better executed than iOS. 3. Data, Storage, WiFi, Battery sense. Data sense helps you manage your mobile data consumption, Storage sense is for storage, Most curious is WiFi sense. It let's you connect to public networks without having to do anything, and let's you share your home internet with your friends/contacts without actually giving them yout wifi password. Battery sense enables you to fine tune each specific app's background activity preference. 4. Universal apps. Chances are you are a Windows user. WP8.1 allow developers to write apps for both Windows 8.1 and WP8.1simultaneously. So you're gonna see a lot of apps crossing over. Point is this phone can be your gateway to this amazing update without having to spend much more on a newer device. 920 runs WP8.1 extremely well, and battery life is still stellar. Hardware is a very curious case on this phone. According to other reviews I gathered even though the phone comes unlocked, they may have been from a carrier. So I was prepared for whatever comes. And sure enough, the one I got is a device from a Mexican carrier, Movistar. But it's default language was English. Phone came with 4 keyboard installed, US, UK English, Mexican Spanish, and Portuguese. Unlocked phone does not necessarily mean unbranded, and the most annoying ramification is the splash screen I have to see if I ever restart the phone, and having updates the phone GDR 1 to all the way up to WP8.1, I've seen that enough for a lifetime. The good part about the device being of Mexican origin is the hardware category. It's RM-820, instead of RM-821 that I had before. It's good because the LTE frequency goes with T-Mobile LTE. It has, 700, 850, 1900, 1700_2100. I don't whey the underscore, but I get LTE now, so I am happy. I do wish the seller would at least separate the boxes based on frequency supported as those are written on the box, but all in all I am happy. This phone is still one of the best looking, best built phone on the market.",Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00B2BYU1Q,"Really Really nice phone. Fast, responsive, you name it. Works on T-mobile, and I do believe that it adapts to LTE because the web pages load much faster than my previous phone that just had the 4G and I see H+ in the corner of the navigation bar. Very nice display, vibrant and crisp. After owning this unit for 2 weeks, I will never go back to Android based phones. This phone comes with Windows 8 but with 4 updates you'll have the full 8.1 package. Windows 8.1 has a simple and clean layout, simply said it looks professional whereas Android has the kids feel to it with garbage cluttered all over the place. Sure you have some limitation to customization in comparison but there are enough options to satisfy most. I really really like the Office programs, Word, Onenote, Powerpoint, Excel Battery lasts me 2 full days, probably can squeeze by with 3 by turning it off at night, with heavy texting and some web page reading as well as email checking on the commute to/from work. So to a heavy user with social media and music playing, there's no reason that that unit wouldn't last you all day long. My only negatives. the sound is not as loud whether it be alerts or music playing. You'd have a hard time hearing alerts given that the phone is your pocket say at a grocery store unless it's set on max. The second and probably most important is this Gorilla Glass the manufacturer speaks off because I don't see it, what I do is is 2 small scratches that have already appeared. How? when the unit's been either in a separate pocket away from things or on the top of my desk. So that tells me that it had to have been from the fingers and hence it would be in your interest in purchasing a protective film because if it scratched this easily,what will happen if you put it in your backpack or purse alongside other items....yea",Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00B2BYU1Q,"Bought two of these for my kids. Neither one likes it. Despite the app availability, which only bothers one of the two, even core features don't work as they should. Would definitely not buy again. A few years ago, these might've been pretty competitive, but it's clear that Microsoft is abandoning the phone. Bummer, because I really liked the interface and interaction with my work PC.",Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00B2BYU1Q,"We got this phone to work with the ""Bring Your Own Phone"" plan with Straight Talk. Even though Straight Talk service generally runs off the Verizon towers, this phone still connects through the AT&T tower (which has horrible service where we live) and are never able to get the data to work as a result. The background noise cancelling technology in the microphone cancels out our voices in addition to the background noise and people have a very hard time hearing us unless we have the call on speakerphone (and sometimes that doesn't even work). We love the look of the phone and it runs well, but it is a pain that it will not transfer over to the Verizon towers and it's getting really old that we have to make all our calls on speakerphone. And...the apps are limited. Fix the microphone issues and expand the app store and this would be a killer phone.",Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00B2BYU1Q,"bought it for myself. pros: good screen size/display and camera; Nokia off-line map is a plus, but it is not as powerful as google map yet with data plan; Large icons are easy to use. cons: the biggest problem is the efficiency/battery duration. programs and games are rather limited, and some of them basically burn the phone very hot though you put them in the background; at least a couple of times the battery died arund 3 or 4 pm in the afternoon; recharging seems to be slow; if I forget to put on charge overnight, it is guaranteed to run of battery in the morning and you'd better not completely rely it for the wake-up call in the morning! The screen is not as strong as I hoped, and I already have several scratches.",Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00B2BYU1Q,"Great phone for the price. You will not find a deal like this at any retail store. Although, they are slow with adding apps to the Nokia line, but they have improved as demand grows. On the other hand, I recommend that you buy this from another seller. I contacted them about an issue I had with the phone, which should have been covered by the warranty it stated in the description. Which they denied. Very unsatisfied customer with this vendor but the product is now fixed, no thanks to them, and works as it should.",Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00B2BYU1Q,"I have been tracking this phone ever since the Nov 2012 release, and I generally had mixed feelings about the types of reviews I read all over the internet. There have been complaints about the weight, about lack of an SD card slot, about it being a Windows phone, the list goes on. However, from experiencing this device for myself, I have to say that while it is not the perfect smartphone, it excels in most areas. The phone weighs 185g - considerably more than all of its direct competitors - but it does not feel like an anvil. It more has a solid, almost unbreakable feel (though I'm not gonna test that). The Samsung Galaxy S3 was one of the main competitors at release date, and though it is lighter and thinner than the Lumia 920, it also feels quite frail in comparison. I don't find the weight of the phone to be a negative attribute. One other concern I had was how the WP8 environment would treat me, as it is well documented and demonstrated all over that the Windows App Store is leagues behind Google and iOS. There are obviously missing popular apps (not least Instagram and Youtube), but I have been able to find ample replacements so far (Metrotube and 6Tag) that do the job. If you aren't one to obsess over a name, then you will find these apps more than capable of handling most, if not all of your activities. The phone boasts silky smooth performance, with great visuals and above average speaker output. As far as media storage goes, I'm not too concerned about the lack of SD card slot. The device already comes with 32gb built-in. Most other flagships at release date topped out at 16gb and not all offered SD storage either. The camera is probably the strongest selling point on any current-gen high end Nokia phone, and believe me, these guys have a right to brag. The camera is simply amazing, and there are a bunch of Nokia-exclusive imaging apps that make the photo experience so much better. Battery life is what I would call average from a smartphone these days and it is probably the biggest negative point on my mind right now. Depending upon usage and settings, battery life can vary greatly. If you are one of the users who turns screen brightness down all the way, turns off all services, and keeps the phone running on barebones features, then you can crank 2 days out of the battery easily. If you are like me - a moderate to heavy user who keeps his screen settings on automatic and doesn't bother to turn off things other than location settings, then you will get upwards of 11 hours out of a full charge. I've seen better, but I've also seen worse. Overall, I'm satisfied with the phone. It was either this or a Xperia Z from Sony. The two are totally different experiences, but both have their strong and weak points. The price difference will probably play a role in the decision as well if you are torn between these 2 (though the release of the Z1 will surely drop the Z's price some more). For anybody questioning why I chose the Lumia 920 over the 925, the reasons are simple. The 925 only has 16gb onboard storage as opposed to 32gb on the 920. The 925 does not have a camera that much better than the 920 The 925 did not come in red :)",Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00B2BYU1Q,"Generally I don't purchase and upgrade my devices because of new versions. I had a Nokia N900 with MAEMO OS for almost 5 years, because of the stability of linux that covered all my needs. I decided that it was the time to upgrade, until the camera and the USB power connector broke one day. I waited for a price drop for the Lumia and finally decided to purchase. It was an awesome experience from the beginning. A nice device, great visual in red. Great power and all my Windows Phone Apps in my hand. Speed is pretty fast and very responsive. I purchased a lot of accesories that sincronized without problems with the Lumia 920. The smart camera when i upgraded to the lastest firmware ""Nokia Black"" was indeed the best one outhere.",Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00B2BYU1Q,"A standard setting phone. While this phone is a generation old it holds up against the newest android and Apple phone. It does Qi wireless charging which Android is starting to do in its next generation. The touch keyboard Nokia created set the standard for the Apple and Android clones of it coming soon. Nokia also set the standard for high-end cameras coming to their competitors. All the improvements making their way to the Android and Apple eco system were already in a windows phone a generation ago. To do this day there is no better phone on the market, except the new version of this phone.",Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00B2BYU1Q,"It's beautiful, easy to use and so fast!. Microsoft do the best work with the OS and Nokia with the phone. Only two issues: First: At the time i received it in my country (Venezuela), four months later (thanks LibertyExpress), I need to Update the phone 5 times (3 updates for Windows Phone, two for Nokia - Lumia Amber and Black) to get the best experience. That was so easy. And second: It has the AT&T logo, but it's okay, it's unlocked. Finally, I have a Smartphone that covers all my mobile needs. I have a powerful camera (Perhaps no more powerful than the Lumia 1020) and now I have a very good reason to celebrate, since I came back to buy one of the Nokia's best masterpieces.",Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00B2BYU1Q,I had no idea I could have written to your company until a few days ago. I purchased a phone from your company through amazon. The order was placed on November 4th 2013. I ordered a Nokia Lumia 920 and your company sent me a Nokia Lumia 900 instead. The phone does not ring or make any sound. All settings and volumes are where it is too be and yet no sound. I am highly disappointed in the deception of your company and will never do any business with you or recommend your company to anyone. I am also disappointed in Amazon for allowing your company to rip off good people of their hard earned money for inferior goods and incorrect goods.,Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00B2BYU1Q,"My first smartphone in a long time.I really like it! :) Smooth, fast (apps could wake up from sleep faster IMO), good design. Looks cool. Works superb with WiFi networks. Good screen, not as good as AMOLED in Samsung Galaxy S2 for example but still clear and I can read fine print on any webpage I open. It can play YouTube videos smoothly. Default Internet Explorer browser works well so I didn't install any replacement. I little hard to quickly configure / update contacts. I do not know why it is so hard to add new phone number to contact... Especially those imported from LinkedIn. I definitely can recommend this phone for everyone who just want to call, send SMS, chat using Viber, Skype, surf network and make decent photos (because camerais not amazing, is good but definitely it could be better). Phone is a little heavy and not so think so you need to have proper size hand to hold it firmly. PS: Nokia maps and augoemnted reality apps are amazing but I can only see myself using those great maps and GPS navigation.",Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00B2BYU1Q,"Excellent phone, but a little disappointed that it is a Portuguese model rather than US model. It works fine on my T-Mobile pay-as-you go plan. The sound quality is outstanding, as is the camera image quality. Update - one year later. The phone touch-screen has died. I have full display and mechanical button function but no way to provide any inputs to the phone. Remedy on-line is to reset the phone but that cannot be done without screen controls (it is true, that's the onlne advice for fixing an unresponsive screen!...really!) A real shame as I really liked the phone.",Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00B2BYU1Q,"Summary: Overall a great phone. Excellent camera and overall responsiveness. I purchased this exclusively to function on Tracfone's Straight Talk network they promote from Walmart. Works perfectly after getting the SIM card installed and setting APN to Straight Talk's. I would have left this at 4 stars before the 8.1 update, however, with Windows Phone 8.1, Microsoft absolutely nailed the quality of life issues I had with the phone. Biggest culprit being integrated playlist creation and editing. Improvement to the lock and start screens also is a big plus. Only con I have right now is that the maps have some issues with GPS location in cities, tends to not get a signal.",Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00B2BYU1Q,"The phone is nice looking but a bit too heavy. Screen is good size if you want something bigger and easy to read. I do not care for the windows functions as I am used to navigating Android apps - but I guess I knew that how it came. Now the worse part, we put a MICRO (did not pay attention that I needed that) SIM card into the phone and my carrier has activated it. The phone got so HOT in 5 min. on that I could not even hold it, not to mention to think about putting it close to my face. When we are being warned about cell phone radiation this phone should be a poster child for that predicament. Sorry but not recommend this for anyone alive.",Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00B2BYU1Q,"I purchased the phobe nokia lumia 920 and this is beautifull. Very good. I recomend. I live in Colombia. Only changed the sim card and work. Woow. Today register in my celular oper. Pros: 1) Finished 2) Resistent 3) Glass of display, very good. 4) fast 5) Office, for the work is excellent. Cons 1) In 4g the temperature battery is high update 21/10/14 I low to 4 stars. The phone is heated quite in games. Not games.",Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00B2BYU1Q,"We love the phone but have received 2 phones that were defective out of 2 phones. I am suspicious of this percentage on a ""NEW"" product since we have owned another Nokia Lumina 920 series 16 gb for 5 years and never had a problem. The phones never made it out of the house after receiving them before they malfunctioned. I am shipping the 2nd defective phone back today. I hope this replacement is defect free. If the next phone is defective I will request a refund.",Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00B2BYU1Q,"I've been a long-time Windows Phone user, and I absolutely love both, Nokia phones and the Windows Phone OS. I've used a Lumia 920 in the past, so I know it's a solid phone. So the 1 star rating is for the state the phone came in, and NOT for Lumia 920. Pros: - The phone is unlocked, as advertised. - There is no carrier branding on the phone chassis. Cons: - The phone came poorly packaged. It was in an opened box, and had clearly been used before. - When I turned the phone on, it did not take me through the Windows Phone ""out of box experience"", where I get to pick the language, settings, etc. Instead, I was taken directly to the start screen. For a phone that's being sold as new, this is NOT acceptable. - The device came from Mexico and has a Movistar carrier branding in the software - splash screen (which cannot be changed), ring tones, background, etc. The fact that I couldn't get rid of the original carrier branding in the software was a huge downer. - The phone is capped to 4G. I know that the Lumia 920 supports LTE, but when I went into the system settings, the ""Highest connection speed"" option only lists 2G, 3G, and 4G. So this must be a cap introduced by the original carrier. Either this must be clearly advertised on the product's page as a limitation, or it must support everything the Lumia 920 is designed to support. Again, unacceptable. - By default, the keyboard and language are set to Spanish, but these could be changed easily, so it wasn't a big concern to me. I bought this phone as a gift, but there were far too many reasons to return this phone, so that's exactly what I did. I'm hugely disappointed in Amazon for allowing such sellers to sell their products here.",Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00B2BYU1Q,"Just writing this review to share my experience with people and also help people decide whether to purchase this product or not. I received this phone on December 31st 2014 and it worked well until 9th January 2015. First problem I had was bad reception or network coverage indoors. Second problem the phone sticks a lot. Third problems is that it overheats frequently. Fourth problem error message comes up on the screen saying "" no bootable option..."" when trying to restart Fifth problem when restarting the phone does not come back on for long periods. Personally I don't know if I was unlucky this time but I think I am not purchasing any windows phone in the future sorry to say. Nokia is a strong brand of phone but if there are software problems such as these then there is no competition with android phones. The phone has a nice shape and overall nice looking apps but to much issues.",Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00B2BYU1Q,"I change phone company and I couldn't use my old phone. I phone it's not much of a phone without apps, galaxy it's ok, but Nokia has always been my choice. I choose Lumia 920. Works with every SIM card. 4G, great antena reception. It says AT&T but it's International unlocked, meaning that I have used it with Mexican Movistar, Mexican Telcel and AT&T in the US. Simply until now, the best phone.",Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00B2BYU1Q,"I had an earlier Nokia 900-920 series phone that worked great for all my needs until it recently died. (Possible battery) This was the closest version I could find. This newer version seems a bit faster and has more memory, but seems to have all the features of my old phone. The only problem I have is the text keyboard is a bit small for my large fingers, but that's my problem not the phone's. The front screen is customizable from small icons to large, so my ""Big fingers"" can select easily. Sure, I had a problem with the first one I received, but Amazon and the sender ""Breed"" made it seem like there was no problem at all, for the ""New"" phone arrived a day earlier than originally planned. ""Great Job, Guys""!",Nokia,"May 23, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"I bought this solely to use as an intermediary transition step for porting my land line phone number over to Google Voice. It worked great, and the LPN had my landline number on this phone for only about four hours, so very good service. Only problem was when I went to port the second number, apparently I couldn't do it with the same SIM because the account had already been activated, then deactivated post-porting to Google Voice. However, Tracfone customer service (foreign call center), after troubleshooting on another phone call with me for 45 minutes finally agreed to send me a new SIM card (took 9 days to receive) and then I could activate again and port the 2nd number. The second time, I decided to give the phone to my son after porting, and called customer service and this time they were able to re-activate on the same 2nd SIM that had just finished the same procedure the first SIM did. Odd, but it worked!",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"I dropped my Samsung 301g and cracked the screen. I ordered a new one from Amazon and after activating it and having my minutes transferred by Tracfone, the web browser would not work. 2 Days of calls to customer service resulted in still no browser. They said that the browser would not connect to the tower. The customer service lady was, as were the ones before her, very polite and extremely courteous to me. This last rep just told me, without me asking her, to wait for a new phone to be sent to me in 3-5 days. Then I will call to get my number and minutes transferred again. I had no problems with the last phone that this one replaced and expect the same for the replacement. All worked great except the lack of a browser. I don't use the browser but need it to download new ring tones.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"I LUV this Fone :)) !! Being disabled and having use of only 1 hand, the fact that this cell has the extended keyboard makes my fone easier to grab either from a table or my handbag! I've used my fone @ least 50 x's and have NOT hit the browser button once, however I did follow Angela G's code advice and it worked :) yay! I continue to purchase Samsung products for myself and others...TOP-RATED in my opinion plus great value! I've had Tracfone for years with 1 call that was promptly answered and settled as quick!

B00280QJFU,"After toting around a smartphone for a few years I decided that I needed a backup. I purchased this as a ""just in case"" - and it's become my primary phone.

Did I mention that I only have to charge it twice a week?",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"This is a pretty neat cheap phone. It activates easy and came with 20 minutes free! I thought that was pretty sick.

B00280QJFU,"This is a great phone for anyone that just wants a basic style phone, bought this as a backup for my android tracfone and for the price you really cant beat it :3",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"Very basic phone but thats all you need to make calls. Cheaper for me that any other ""unlimited"" plan out there. I only use it when I really have to ... not to chit chat...I am very happy.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"The phone is terrible. Half the time I can not get any service, and there is no way I can make a call from inside my house. I just ordered new phones this morning, and I hope they work!",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"Functional and have many great apps, but the signal indoor is not good.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,item was as described and arrived earlier than expected. Old school phone but great for backup,Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"I really like my new phone, never seen one like this before it is different. I would recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a unique phone to use. Thanks again",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"The phone works fine. The coupons from Tracfone included were out of date. I tried to get Tracfone to replace them ,but was unable to get them to do that.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,My daughter loves it,Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"I have charged this phone, and I have studied every manual that came with it, and tried and tried, with no success. Nor could I find a Help option to call. Useless. H Fingarette] fingarette@gmail.com",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,No way to unlock this one. You should use (Trafone) only to use this phone. I tried to find unlock number but there is no way for this cellular.,Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,i have not got the phone yet but i heard it is really good and it is really cool. and i am excited to get it,Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"I ordered the phone because it is the same model as one that I had that stopped working. When I got it, I found out that I could not unlock the phone and it was therefore useless to me so I returned it. The no unlock rule was on the packaging when I received it but I did not see it on the Amazon Website. That aside, the TracPhone charges are ridiculously high. I recommend T-Mobile's prepay plan.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"My wife and I each have one of this model Tracfone. Neither has been a problem with outgoing or incoming calls. No dropped calls. Voice quality has been clear and natural sounding. We haven't yet found any areas where the phone won't work, and this covers New England to Oregon. Those are the ""pros."" The following are the ""cons,"" along with some physical features we would like to see improved: - One of my biggest cons is the fact that the browser key is fixed and cannot be changed or disabled. The prompt that gets you into this limited browser can be easily activated and cost you fractions of minutes. - I carry my T301G sideways in a belt holder. I have occasionally missed a call when extracting the phone and quickly pressing the ""off"" button by mistake. This won't shut the phone off, but it will cancel the incoming call. - The little, raised line under the display is used to slide the phone open. This line is too small and and just about useless to use. A rubber, or ribbed area on the side of the phone would be much more useful to slide the phone up. I find the process to be a ""two thumbs"" operation if you don't want to press on the LED display all the time - or activate one of the soft keys which are much too close. - My previous Tracfone was a ""clamshell"" V176. This has a rubber feel to the phone, and I never thought I might drop the thing because of a slick, or slippery exterior. I wish the T301G was made from the same material - although I have not yet dropped this phone. - The four soft keys can be programmed for whatever you want. I have found that assigning your ""contact list,"" messages, list of incoming calls and phone info (minutes and time left) works best for me. The keys themselves, however, are still too small. The ""incoming calls"" one is needed for when I mistakenly disconnect a call as mentioned above. - I found the phone information that constantly scrolls across the screen to be distracting and irritating. I was able to shut this function off through the menu though. The press of one of the soft keys now tells me this information. The above ""cons"" are not a deal breaker for me. Life with this phone would be just a little easier if they were addressed. Some other thoughts: - I have never had trouble adding minutes to either phone. I do it over the internet. All they want is your phone number (as long as the phone is registered with Tracfone - easy to do). You purchase the minutes/time and they appear on the phone almost immediately. Keep the phone ""on"" while doing this. - My V176 lasted almost six years with no problems until the last two weeks of it's life. If I can get this same performance from the T301G, then (for the price)I think it will be worth it. - I know it would make the phone a bit larger, but I wish the soft keys, menu and browser keys, and key pad itself were a little larger. Less room for error and more comfortable to use. - I have the phone set to answer (or call) when the slide is used. I don't think the browser will activate, by accident, when the phone is closed, because it's locked then. (Edit on the above - If the phone is ""on,"" then the browser will activate even when the phone closed (locked). This ""con"" continues to grow larger) Not a great camera, but it will do in a pinch. The volume control is on the side of the phone. Ascending from 1 thru 7. One press below 1 puts the phone on vibrate. Easy. All-in-all, this is a nice little phone, for the price, and the fact that no contracts are involved. Much less expensive to operate than than most any other phone. It would, (at least for me) be the perfect little phone if the above ""cons"" could be ironed out. __________________________________ March, 2014 -I have to add these thoughts to the above review. It's been just about four years since I wrote the above comments. The necessity of opening the phone by placing a thumb on the screen has not been a problem at all. The rugged little screen is no worse for the constant manipulation. My wife and I were up in mid-Maine last May. I had my new Apple iPhone with me. Three of the others I was with had iPhones and one android phone. It was necessary to call a person at the local historical society. These four ""high end"" phones got ""no service"" in this remote area. I remembered that I had the Tracfone in the glove compartment, because I still had a couple of months of time left on the phone. Yes - you guessed it - the Samsung T301G made this call just fine. No, the T301G doesn't take really clear photos and it's difficult to send a text or record appointments. But, it was the only device (out of five) that actually made a telephone call! You know I put another year on the T301G and have it with me when I need to travel to these out-of-the-way places. I can now add ""dependable"" to the list of positive comments above. I don't know why the Tracfone was the only one able to make the important call - I just know that it did. The above ""cons"" are still valid, but have not been the problem I anticipated when writing the initial post. This phone is a gem.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"Just had to add my two cents. I read the reviews about the ease of accidentally hitting the browser button and losing minutes, and I ordered this phone anyway. And I agree 100% about the browser. While setting up the phone I have lost a few minutes already by accidentally hitting the darn browser key. What a dumb place to put a browser key! (It's the top right button on the front of the phone, and if you bump it, hit it, press it accidentally (even when the phone is in the closed position), if your phone is on, you will lose 0.5 minutes. I have searched all over the web and there is no way to disable it, or at least have it ask you if you want to connect. Terrible terrible feature. I also followed the instructions of another reviewer and entered *#4777*8665# and followed the instructions, and it doesn't work for me, and from other sites I have found out, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I am going to see over the next month how much time I lose, and then I may have to take another reviewer's advice from another website and glue the button shut. (He said this worked for him fine and you can still get to the browser from the menu button). I cannot recommend this phone to anyone who has kids, your kids will drain their minutes by accident.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"I purchased mine at a K-mart about a year ago. I fell in love with it and added some games to it by using credits (minutes) I had accumulated. The features are great and even though the internet access was a bit shaky and slow, that didn't matter to me since I didn't use it much for that purpose anyway. The coolest thing about this phone is I was helping my brother pull his boat up next to a dock and the phone slipped out of my pocket and into the water. Even though I only paid twenty bucks for it, new, I also had some 300 minutes on it and also some pictures I took, so I was dissapointed I would lose them both. I just looked at the phone sitting there on the sand, and even though I knew there wasn't much chance for it, I stretched my hand down as far as I could and retrieved the phone. The window lit up when I shook the water from it. My brother said I would have to take it apart right away and dry everything as quickly as possible. I wasn't sure how to take it apart, and didn't have any tools, but it was still working, so I figured it might be okay. Later the screen wouldn't come on, and I thought it was done. An hour or two later, the screen began to work again, but the key pad wouldn't work. A couple of hours later, the keypad began working again, and everything was fine. It has been fine ever since and that was over a week ago. The only thing I don't like is that the only way to retreive the pictures is to send them via e-mail to the computer. It does offer double minutes, so I figure it is still worth it. Now I get a kick out of using it knowing it laid on the sand under two feet of water and still works great.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"UPDATE: December 8, 2011 In the past year, I have gone through 3 of these phones. Based on that, the Samsung T301G has got to be one of the worst phones ever made. The main problem is that when the phone breaks, Tracfone sends out a REFURBISHED one. The refurbs were probably returned for the same reason as I returned my first phone (it was freezing and finally became unresponsive). After I called to ask that they send me a new phone, they said OK but they again sent a used one. I'm only going to activate it because most of their other phones have also gotten bad reviews. I picked this Tracfone after my Motorola broke after 2 years of use. This phone has very, very short batter life (needs to be charged every other day even if it hasn't been used very much) and it's Bluetooth function does NOT work with my Bluetooth enabled GPS and other devices for hands-free calling. The only positive is that the phone looks better than the Motorola and that it's faster at sending/receiving text messages, even though the controls and buttons to type the text are very small and hard to get used to. To sum it all up, if you can, please buy a different phone and save yourself the headache of having a broken phone every 3 months (and that's in the case of a NEW one. Used/Refurbished ones are broken OUT OF THE BOX). Tracfone used to be good, but with this, one of the worst phones ever made, and the fact that they keep sending me a used one makes them one of the most annoying companies I've had to deal with.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,I spent time today looking for a new phone. All I see is heartbleed issues and battery eaters. I have used this phone since they came out with it. I never have battery problems. I have played Sudoku till my eyes hurt. It takes pretty nice pictures. It has a voice recorder that I even forget to use. The alarm clock is great. The bluetooth never worked. I dropped it once in Walmart and the headphone and USB cable never worked after that. But it does make calls and receive calls like it should. I used the browser occasionally. I don't think the browser works anymore. I can still email photos to my email. I think it is time for a new phone. The amazing thing is I found it in my purse lining. I traveled this week and couldn't find my phone. I thought it was lost forever. It kept sending out a low battery signal and I could hear where it was. I had a hole in my purse lining and the phone had slipped into the lining. The battery life is still amazing. Not sure what to do with a phone that really is a phone.,Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"This phone is darn good EXCEPT, the browser is tied to the back button. So if you press the back button too many times, $.50 gets deducted when the browser is activated. No warnings of money to be taken. Unbelievable design flaw. Or maybe a scam by design. Otherwise, for the $30 I paid, its very good. I'm returning it now. No more samsung for me. FOLLOW-UP 1/25/2011: Apparently this flaw which prevents me from NOT getting this phone is NOT samsungs fault. I ordered a different replacement phone from TracFone/Net10 (same co.) and it does the same thing. They are programming these phones to do this. The manual says the key is attached to the contact list where the TracFone/Net10 version is attached to the Web and not re-programmable. So its not the phone. Sorry about that. It is a good phone otherwise but not with the Tracfone/Net10 folks. I left it at one star so folks can read the caveat if they use it with Tracfone/Net10.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"I have another Tracfone (a simple Motorola flip) that I love. If it were still available I would have purchased it. I'm not a heavy cell phone user so prepaids are great for me. Why a got a second phone is a long, boring story. The bottom line is when this Samsung is immediately next to my Motorola in my home, it has sometimes has only 2 bars while my Motorola has four. I've had it in areas where there is generally excellent cell coverage where it has no reception/signal at all while my Motorola (again, immediately next to the Samsung) has four bars and is working fine. I have gotten nowhere near the standby battery life that is cited on Tracfone's product description. Most of my conversations are in the 1-3 minute range. Most days I make fewer than three calls. I can't imagine how short the battery life would be if I actually used it to talk for any period of time. Even fully charged at the beginning of the day the battery shows as low by the end of the day or the next AM. While there are some nice features (being able to assign ring tones to contacts) that my older phone doesn't have, those features are worthless if I can't make calls or the battery is dead or dying.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"This phone is OK. The one thing that is really bad about this phone though is that if someone texts you, something will pop up on the screen that says ""1 new message"" and the time and date that the message was sent, that's good but it doesn't say who the message is from until you view the message. So sometimes it doesn't matter if it shows you who it's from or not, but a lot of times it does because after you open the message, minutes get deducted, so you could open a text from someone you don't know or open a text that you don't want to respond to, and you won't know who it's from until after your minutes get deducted. I have wasted a lot of minutes because of that. Although, when someone calls you it DOES say who the call is from. I am planning on getting a new phone that shows who your text messages are from. -Jill, Age 12",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"Others have mentioned the same problems I have with the Samsung T301G: must recharge at least every 3 days and browser key is too easy to hit accidentally. Photos grainy and that I know of, no way to download onto a computer. Yes, sometimes locks up randomly in spite of using the menu to leave it unlocked. (Can unlock by entering code 1234.) In addition, even with the loudest ring tone I can find, I can't hear it ring unless I'm in a totally quiet room--though I have no difficulty hearing my Motorola 370. Most annoying perhaps, is the fact that once you reach the name & number you want on the contact menu, you still to scroll through more options to reach ""Call"", instead of being able to just press the green button to ""Send"". And why in the world is ""Call"" not option #1 instead of #4? It's an unnecessary step. Sending a text could be simplified. Having said all of that, sound quality and volume levels are excellent when making calls. It also has an excellent system of options for being able to view and delete information for missed calls and messages. Tracfone itself? In 7 years with them, while it sometimes requires a wait (like most companies!), once you get through, they're usually able to solve the problem pretty quickly. And when my daughter hits a dead area with her AT&T phone, I hand her my Tracfone and she makes her call. (We live in Oregon, Portland area.)",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,Very light in weight. (my 7 yr old can slap it in half easily) Voice is crisp and clear while talking. The speaker phone is clear but needs to be on the highest setting. The browser button is badly located. Accidentally press it couple of times. You cannot change the menu. (Menu and Browser) You can change the shortcut buttons. Fingerprints on screen of course. Easily slide opened. Limited access to the web. Tracfone locked some of its feature I believe. You cannot email of Google. It is great standard phone for making calls only.,Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"I replaced my Motorola w376g, with this model, as I can't get the w376g in my area anymore. I'm disappointed with the T301G. * It reception isn't as good as the motorola's. * The battery lasts only 3 days on standby * The keypad is recessed making it awkward, its taking me quite a while to get used to it * Reception comes and goes even when its strong * The camera takes grainy photos There are only a couple of things I like about the phone: * The phone's default setting has the key lock on, especially convenient because the web browser button is on the outside * Its fairly small, only a tad larger than my motorola * Good voice quality After reading all these good reviews, I wonder if I got a dud. //Edit Oct 20 I exchanged this one for another of the same model. The reception was even worse than the first one.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"Tracfone still has the best geographic coverage of the pay as you go cell phone options. I had tried a Common Cents option when I wanted to upgrade to a phone with Bluetooth capabilities to work with a newly acquired car and bought in to the Common Cents hype about lower per minute cost and the round down on partial minutes of airtime. What Common Cents does not emphasize in their advertising is that there is absolutely no roaming. If you are outside of the Sprint network coverage area the phone will not work. Just because you have a friend or acquaintance with a Sprint Contract phone that gets coverage in the areas that you travel does not ensure that a Common Cents phone will work in those areas. I subsequently upgraded my Tracfone to the Samsung t301g which did pair with my Ford Sync system and allows hand free calling. I was unable to get the contact list from the phone uploaded to the Sync system but Ford does have some free downloadable software that allows you to create a contact list on your computer and then transfer it to the vehicle via a USB data key. The phone documentation is minimal and the download available from TracFone adds very little information. The default ringtone is progressive, starts out soft and gets louder, and I doubt that anyone will hear the first two rings in a store, restaurant or car. There are several other ringtones built in and I found one that was satisfactory when the volume is adjusted upward. The call volume is also adjustable during a call and most people will probably need to set it near the maximum for use with the hands free calling options with Ford Sync. One peculiarity of the phone is that there is no provision for setting the date and time manually and the time picked up from the network is about two minutes slow. I initiated a support request via email and one week, four emails and about 2 hours spent on the phone with three ""customer support"" representatives I finally received an email confirming that there was no way to manually adjust the time, that they could do nothing about the incorrect (Compared to NIST)time, and stating that the ""issue had been addressed"", which in my opinion is not the same as the issue being resolved. While the ""Customer Support"" representative were courteous, they speak a dialect that is difficult to understand and one every call you spend at least five minutes repeating information that you provided in you initial support request and all of your previous calls and then long periods on hold as they ""check with a supervisor"" or search ""their system"" for additional information regarding your problem. In summary the phone is usable and does provide some functionality with Ford Sync systems at a reasonable price when you factor in that you get double minutes for the life of the phone. TracFone support is basically non-existent. If you are the type that reads manuals and are willing to do some internet research Tracfone provides ""as needed airtime"" at a reasonable cost. If you are the type that likes or needs some hand holding you should probably look elsewhere and if you have become dependent on a cell phone to provide the correct time you definitely need a different phone.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"I ordered 2 of these phones for use as TracFones. Both of them had to have the SIM card replaced. One still didn't work after the card was put in place, so it took numerous customer service calls to get it going. Both phones have no voice mail features. Whenever I try to access the voice mail option, the phone won't allow me to enter. I had to place more calls to customer service and have yet to have this problem resolved. It's been nearly 3 weeks now! How much of this is the phone and how much is the service, I can't say. But since the phone is a TracFone exclusive, it all seems to tie together.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"

B00280QJFU,"If you live in an area where there is any question about cell phone service....then read on before you buy a Tracfone on-line. You cannot return a phone using Tracfone on-line, you have to call them to get an RA# and then they tell you to call them to provide the Tracking number. Let me clarify....I bought my Tracfone directly...not through Amazon, so this is in no way a reflection on Amazon. Here is what it took to get RA #...4 calls/over 2 days. 2 calls were dropped by Tracfone due to volume. I waited 20 minutes on the 3rd, without reaching an agent (I had to drop). 4th call I waited 15 minutes to get an agent. Then it took another 30 minutes for them to ask all the questions. First, why I was returning the phone {phone was fine...service was 2 bars or less at home]. Then, I had to give them all my contact information (which should have popped up, because I gave them my order number). After all this effort I gasped when they told me that I had to call them with the return tracking number to ensure I got my refund. I thought that they were being nice when they gave me an unpublished number to call. Silly me, I am on my 6th dropped call due to high volume....still have not been able to get through on either line. It has been another two days of trying.

B00280QJFU,"Maybe I'll figure it out in the future and update this post accordingly to reflect some new revelation. At this current time though, I am quite confused as to how one can still accidentally hit the browser button months after getting the phone. I can understand accidentally hitting it until you stop doing so due to a learned response; ""Fire is hot, and burns, causing pain. Don't touch the fire."" It's as if people are making some conspiracy out of this button. Samsung sells a ton of Galaxy smartphones for hundreds of dollars to millions of people. I don't think the literal 2 dollars a month you might waste due to this button is going to affect their bottom line. Don't get me wrong, I like a good conspiracy but I'm not seeing it here.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"I did not get much use out of this phone. In fact I haven't used it at all. To understand what I'm saying first you must get the explanation on why I purchased this phone. My younger brother had a tracfone and he lost the battery. How he managed to do that? Well I have no idea. Anyway the reason this phone was purchased was so he could just switch his sim card into it and move on with his life and my mother had recently purchased a year's worth of service on his original phone. Unfortunately Tracfone will not allow you to switch sim cards into a new phone, even though these both use the exact same model card. They will however make exceptions if you call in and talk to a representative in person.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"I carry this phone with me daily. It's a decent phone. I don't particularly like it because I have to be outside to get a strong signal, I get a fair signal in the car. Less than fair at home, and no signal at work, in a store, school, or hospital. But, it is mainly for when I am out and about. Or emergency. I just hope I don't have to rely on it for an emergency at work. However. It was very inexpensive. Down right cheap. So, I guess you get what you pay for.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"nice replacement phone with out the crazy price. i just use the phone for emergencies but its easy to learn, nice color resolution for a older style phone....only down side is its a prepaid phone and with the browser botton right at your finger tips....it only comes handy if you have internet. If not its easy to press it by mistake and use your prepaid mins just for a sec.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"A few comments on this phone: 1) The builtin ringtones are lame, they're uninspiring, almost random sounding ""tunes,"" however I find the ring volume loud enough, in contrast to complaints from some users that it's too low. Perhaps Samsung fixed this issue. 2) The screen is 2"" diagonal, which is a good size for a low end phone, however the low resolution makes it a bit grainy. Also it has a narrow viewing angle, i.e. you have to hold it at a certain angle or it appears dark or washed out. 3) The mobile web capability is very limited because of the phone's low memory. Originally Tracfone only allowed you to go to a set of preselected sites. Now you can enter any URL, but most of the time you get an insufficent memory error because the site is too large. I mainly use it to get info. by searching Google, in lieu of the Google SMS service that they discontinued. 4) As others have noted, when you close the slider the outer buttons don't lock immediately, you have to wait a few seconds before putting it in your pocket, otherwise the browser button could get pushed and you can lose a lot of minutes. 5) Battery standby time is less than a week, which is lower than other phones I've used. On the other hand it recharges faster than usual. EDIT: I recently charged the phone on a Sunday night, and it lasted until the next Monday morning, with light usage during the week. It will stay at one battery bar for a while and still be functional. When you recharge it, there doesn't seem to be any alert when it is finished, you have to just see if the battery icon is full. 6) The menu screens have a black and orange color scheme which, while readable, is a bit odd. I got it when it was $8, from Dealathon, and I'm still using it. Overall I'd say it is worth the current price of $5, for those of us who are not into the complexity and cost of smartphones. You can upgrade to another Tracfone later on. You can connect it to your Windows PC using a free program from Samsung and a cable you can get from Amazon for a few dollars, see this thread on the Howard forum: [...] ONE ADDITIONAL NOTE: Unlike some of their other phones, Samsung doesn't provide a PDF booklet/manual for this phone. However, the Samsung T245G flip phone has features that are mostly similar and that does have a manual at [...] The main menus of the two phones are the same except for item #6, which on the T301G is ""Games & Apps"" while on the T245G it is ""Camera."" In actuality, the ""Games & Apps"" item on the T301G contains Games and the Camera function, so that item is not properly named. While the T245G doesn't have games, just the Camera function.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"Does the job. Nothing fancy but provides a cheap, adequate cell phone for someone that just wants to use it for emergencies and when there is no other option available. However, it is fragile. This is the 3rd one I've bought for my teenage daughter in a little over a year but my wife and myself have not had anyting happen to ours.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"I got it because of trouble with another phone. I found it on sale here for $5.00 and got it. So far, it seems to be working okay. I have made a few calls and was told the calls were clear and no crackling in the background. Not a bad deal.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"I cannot believe how well this phone works given the amount I paid for it. It was actually less than the cost of a package of cigarettes! Stylish, easy to use, and just as advertised. Amazon has done it again!",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,The phone is perfect for my needs. I am a Senior and need an emergency phone in my truck. The phone is inexpensive and performs great with clear sounding audio on both ends of the circuit. The carrier (Tracfone) offers various plans that should meet most requirements for a backup full featured phone.,Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"It's not the most exciting phone...but it has triple minutes, its easy to use, and cost $5. I bought it for my 7th grader to text me after games or practices. When it fell in the water and broke I simply ordered another :)",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"I love the simplicity of its operation, and I have had others but this is a great phone. I lost it for 6 months and when it was found , it was as if I had just met an old friend who I had not seen in years.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,Only $10 and it works within minutes of opening the package. You can't beat this buy for a quick second phone.,Samsung,"December 5, 2021"

B00280QJFU,"Great fone. bought thru Amazon. Just as described....Only cincern, you have to use their browser, other wise, a good fone",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"

B00280QJFU,Awesome buy and excellent delivery time.,Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,its not bad. it comes with 20 free minutes. I had no problems working the phone either. but the down side is it came with expired coupons from 2 years ago,Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,Good value for the price! You can't go wrong paying less than nine dollars and have bluetooth and a camera. Phone slides up to unlock and reveal the keyboard.,Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,useful !!!,Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,Washed my other phone. Wanted one to fit my needs so I found a repeat. Very satisfied. Would buy again,Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,Phone came with coupons from 2011-12 so phone is an older model. Not bad for $3.59,Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,I found this fone to be a nice size and it had all the features except the mp3 player so I am unable to download music. but that is ok I feel that those ear plugs are dangerous when you are walikg down the streets of mean nasty NYC..,Samsung,"December 5, 2021"

B00280QJFU,"You may turn off GPRS (mobile web/MMS) to save battery life if you do not use GPRS features. However, the option requires accessing a secret menu. This is how: Open the slider and type *#4777*8665# and a menu should pop up. Go to menu number 5, Attach Mode. Select Manual attach. OK. It will inform you that you need to restart the phone for this to take effect - do this later. Then go to menu number 2, GPRS detach. The phone will notify you that it has done the GPRS detach, which means that it is no longer connected to the GPRS network. Now restart the phone, and there should be a blue and white G at the top of the screen instead of a red and white one. Success! Of course, you may reverse this at any time by going back to the secret menu and selecting Auto attach and GPRS attach. This will NOT adversely affect your ability to add minutes to the phone via [...] or by using a minutes card purchased in a store. If blocking the browser makes you unable to add minutes directly from the phone, just GPRS attach again and you'll be fine.

B00280QJFU,"This is a really good phone if you just need a basic model for low use, or just to keep for emergencies. I've had the big phone contracts, but now, I do not need that and I cannot justify paying that bill every month for a phone that I rarely use. I previously had a samsung katalyst and before that a samsung flip phone, I love the samsung phones they are really good quality and stand up to a decent amount of abuse. This particular phone is a cheaper model, but is similar to the Katalyst that I just finished up with. So far it's been good, sound quality is good. I also want to touch on tracphone's customer service. I had to call them because the minutes I placed on my phone didn't show up on the phone after several attempts to retrieve them, Customer service was excellent! They walked be through what to do and problem solved, they were very polite and curtious as well, all around a great experience. Did have to wait on hold either; my call was answered quickly and efficently. I'm definetly happy that I decided to go with the tracphone!!!",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"My minutes just would evaporate on this phone. One day I would have 100 minutes and pick up the phone out of my purse and it would have 80. Then 80 to 60, then 60 to 30 and I had not made a call. Didn't know why, still don't know why unless like the other reviewers said the browser was accidentally being turned on. Tracfone replaced it first saying the phone was defective, but the new one is doing the same thing. MINUTES DISAPPEAR. When I complained was told several times by the first two women that the phone was working properly and they did their best to dismiss me. So, I asked if they were calling me a liar. Finally they decided to send me a new, different brand of phone. What irks me about this entire situation is, you KNOW they KNEW what was happening to me, yet feigned ignorance. After I told them I had been a faithful tracfone user for eight years and did not have this problem with my other phone, did their attitude change a bit. Still very upset the way they treated me, but it is typical of the way companies treat their customers these days. AT&T is worse, much worse. If I had a choice I would change. In fact, I felt like just giving up all this technology and doing without a cell phone. How much do we have to pay to be treated like garbage? Tracfone you are the pits today. It's terrible to waste so much time talking to these people, even if in the end they do what is right. I know I was on the phone way over an hour. They knew all along what it was, and kept denying there was a problem. My blood pressure I am sure was skyrocketing.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"You can read on an unopened package what features a phone has but what people really need to hear is how those features you use most ""work."" It's a well built phone that I will use mostly for talking and limited texting. My main concerns about a phone are its quality and its audio performance (both incoming and outgoing). Because I have owned and used all three, I can compare this phone to the LG600G and the Motorola W376G and this one is the winner hands down! Audio is as good or better than the Motorola 376 and even better quality of construction. The 376 has a ""flimsy"" key pad not conducive to large finger tips and its silver case scratches easily. The LG600G (or at least the one I received) had POOR quality audio coming and going - nobody sounded like them self and it was not sharp and clear. Samsung produced some features you don't see in the average ""prepay plan phones."" The one I appreciate most is an added touch that speaks to the quality of Samsung products and it is the ability to adjust total sound levels up or down depending on your environment (normal, silent, driving and outdoors). They'll continue to improve as time goes on but for the present, the T301G is the best that TracFone offers and is an excellent phone.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"As some of you have discovered these phones, along with many others, have a habit of accidentally dialing the browser when you place the phone in your holster and eating up lots of minutes. The simple fix is to wait about five seconds for the screen to go blank before placing the phone in the holster. This locks the keys until you press unlock then OK or slide the phone open. The browser will not dial if you wait these few seconds. It's a pain and stupid on Samsung's part but it's the only way to prevent this problem, there's no way to lock out the browser.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"I found Tracfone coverage in AC 508 spotty at best, non-existent in most towns on MVY. ""Customer Service"" (as many other reviewers point out) is a joke, the operators are not only unwilling but also incapable of giving any kind of explanation why the service varies so greatly within a few hundred feet, also depending on the time of day. You may find yourself in a ""black hole"". The little Samsung works OK, the display is bright and the buttons not too responsive (except the cursed browser one). Volume control is not quite up to par. The menu to access functions is unncessarily complicated and not at all intuitive.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"Read other reviews for pros/cons, but do note that the dual use charger-headset jack is not micro or mini USB. According to Samsung and a local dealer, there is no adapter available. None of the multiple adapters provided with the phone will work w/the proprietary jack. So, you cannot use your own plug-in headset or a universal external extended battery, and there are no OEM extended batteries w/cover. I was told by a dealer that post 2008 phones must have compatible micro or mini jacks, and T301g is older. If this is not an issue for you, the phone is a very good simple phone, especially once the browser is disabled. These are problems for me, and may be for you: 1. microphone quality of provided headset is significantly lower than the Plantronics I was using; 2. I am in a rural area and the battery use is higher than the previous Motorola tracfone, so other battery options are helpful; 3. bluetooth costs more than the phone, and given phone and battery life, didn't seem a worthwhile investment.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"When I first tried out tracfone, I bought this phone. I got it on sale for $19.99 and it had double minutes for life. It worked so well, I got it for myself, then my wife saw it and wanted one for her. I find the battery life is actually pretty good as is the reception. This is a great little phone! UPDATE: 4-6-14: My wife wanted to go back to a Basic phone. She said she wanted a tracfone that was a flip phone, however, when she remembered that we had these from years ago, she opted to return to this Model. Great little phone!",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"The Samsung T301G Tracfone has many more features than stated. From a very adjustable camera. To the ability to record your own ring tone. Sending & receiving email, up to 640 x 480 graphics. The ONLY detraction is the sound quality of it's transmitted signal. (You might sound tinny to the people you call when the battery gets low.) Overall though, I give this phone high marks. You won't get a better phone at anywhere near this price.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"I've used mine for several years and overall have been pleased. Don't use it much. But I have tried it in California, Florida, and the midwest and never had a dropped call. Biggest complaint is it sometimes will turn on by itself and use up power. Note that there is no card to store pictures. The best way to transfer photos from the phone is to connect it to your computer, and copy them.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"Exactly the kind of mobile phone I need as a back-up emergency phone. Easy to activate online & easy to use. If you're looking for a basic phone with some nice added features, this one could be for you. I've had Samsung mobile phones in the past and have been pleased with the quality.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"I was a Tracfone customer for years and have to say that this was one of the worst Tracfones that I owned. PROS: 1) Cool design 2) Easy to use interface CONS: 1) Quiet ringers 2) Phone got a terrible signal 3) Hard to hold onto- the shape of the phone is not hand friendly 4) Terrible voice quality and tons of dropped calls 5) Phone often slid open on its own After I bought this phone I was sorry that I switched from the LG 600G phone, which is easily the best Tracfone being offered.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"I like this phone ""OK"". I've have simple needs and this phone works well, but I have to subtract a couple of stars because of that darn browser button that I have hit several times by accident, costing me 1/2 unit of airtime each time. It screams of a ""SCAM"" to reduce your airtime/units, and there seems to be no way to fix this issue. I also have some concern as to how durable the phone would be, should I drop it when it's not in the case I bought for it off eBay. Finally, the screen is difficult to read in sunlight. But other than these things, the phone seems to suit my needs well enough, and saves me a lot of money versus an overpriced ""gotcha"" contract plan.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"The browser button is on the face of this flip phone. It often gets triggered when you try to answer a call or when you put the phone in your pocket. You get charged a minimum of 1/2 minute whenever this happens. I never use my browser, but TracPhone can not disable internet service for your handset, nor will they reimburse you for accidental triggering of this button. :(",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,A good backup phone that can be maintained at a very low cost.,Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"My phone had excellent reception in metro Detroit area. Fair camera quality. Bluetooth headset sync was easy. Have to pay TracFon 4min. to transfer photos :( because Bluetooth and x-fer cable is disabled. Some photos took 2 attempts (8 minutes!). Purchased the phone from my local Target, but Tracfon had to send a new SIM card to activate it. Phone started to die after 6 months; often can't turn it off. When it is off, you can see the keypad flash like it is trying to turn on. Drains the battery over night. Might go away after charging, but full or low battery does not effect problem. Tracfon will not let me just swap the SIM card to a new phone, so all the contact info will be lost :( I expected better.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"So long as you don't require customer service, tracfone is fine. But if you do, expect a foretaste of hell. I really appreciate it when I say something to a rep and they proceed as if I had never said anything. And if for any reason you deserve a refund, well, say your prayers but don't expect them to be answered. I switched to another company.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,it's ok did not used it,Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"This is an excellent Samsung prepaid phone. Organizes well, high quality, and perfectly priced. You really can't beat it. It's very easy to use too. The Tracfone service offers everything - from big savings each month to awesome coast to coast coverage nationwide. It has everything you need in a cell phone, but without a monthly overcharged cell phone bill. Def reccommend this phone and service to anyone looking for a great deal.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"I don't really know alot about phones but if I was to buy these phones just because it's cheap and it says prepaid on it, can I still just put my own sim card in there. will it still work or do i have to stick with the sim card that comes with it that is prepaid?",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,Left for vacation and my LG600g phone was in the console. At 2am thought it was safe when valet parked it. GONE. Bought this phone because it had bluetooth and a couple other features the 600 didn't. BEWARE! Bluetooth will not connect to your computer for file transfer. Only for headset. Buttons hard to use. 2 steps to unlock slider. Called Tracfone Indian CS AND THEY WOULDN'T GIVE ME THE MINUTES PROMISED FROM THE 600. No answer from Emails. Returning this phone. Calling CS again shortly.,Samsung,"December 5, 2021"

B00280QJFU,"I was very disappointed in this phone. Despite Tracfone telling me it was good in my area it did not tell me that web access or multimedia support does not work in my area. I can't send a picture, browse the web or send email. I went to tracfone to download ringtones on my computer and the download failed, but I was still charged for the ringtone. Trying to get technical support I was only allowed to buy new airtime. Phone support personnel do not have any good english speaking skills. The three calls to tech support sounded like they were in a concert hall and they could not resolve my issues. Tracfone is fine for $20 phone and text service and a 3 month card for $20-40, but using tracfone with this phone is a disappointment and I don't recommend it unless you know that web & multimedia support is available in your area.",Samsung,"December 5, 2021"
B00280QJFU,"Battery life is too short (cheap battery). Even if you do not use the phone and simply leave it ON, you will need to recharge it every 3 days. Indoor reception is poor.

B00280QJFU,"3 people in my family have this HORRID phone! This phone will randomly LOCK itself up. You power off one day...then BOOM. You try to turn the phone back on, and it is 'locked'. It will have a space for you to enter a passcode. GOOD LUCK guessing what it is! Customer Service at Tracfone said: "" buy a new phone"" (a.k.a. TRASH this one) ""...and we will switch your service over to it."" TRASH. GARBAGE. Stay away from this one, folks. I searched online, and it seems this is a pretty common thing for this phone.

The phone is comfortable to use (something that couldn't be said for the Motorola flip phones), snaps closed with a solid feel, and the menus are straightforward. Call quality with AT&T is very good. There are two things that could be improved: there should be a way to get photos off the phone without having to send a video text message, and it would be nice to be able to import phone numbers from a PC. For the price though it's no big deal. Other than those quibbles we're very happy with the phone.",Samsung,"August 20, 2021"

B003FCO9XE,"I purchased these 2 additional phones as replacements for the current ones my sweetheart keeps destroying....over & over & over. I purchased the originals in 2009. He destroyed his 1st one (temper..temper..) in 2010. So I traided and gave him mine so he could go on a trip and be in touch if needed. On returning, that phone was run over...bummer! Replaced 2 more, Yup, his was accidentally dumped into a glass of fortified grapefruit juice.(that doesn't work well) I bought another one for him which he still has (so far). So, I decided to buy 2 more and keep them in stock for insurance. One thing I am disappointed with is they come with a $10.00 (30 Day) initial allotment but that is not added to your balance when you have to replace the phone. Oh well! I like these phones because I can get the service for $100.00 a year for now. We only use them for emergency so I re-fill both of them once a year. I just don't think anyone can get better service for that amount. I gave it 3 stars because I / we don't use all the bells and wistles it is capable of and it doesn't come close to being in competition with many other phones but I can take pictures, not the greatest quality but still OK. and e-mail. It's capable of internet connection if needed but that eats up minutes instantly. It has more capabilities also but being financially restricted I just keep expenses as minimal as possible. (K.I.S.S.) These are OK phones and for emergencies it takes care of that requirement. The cell service itself is normal & adequate. Yes I would recommend it to anyone as an emergency phone.",Samsung,"November 20, 2021"

However, due to reception issues, we switched her back to verizon, but this time prepaid. The prices for Verizon's prepaid per minute are not as great as the previous carrier, but this phone is great! It's almost identical to my mom's contract samsung phone, which lasted her years, except this phone is a little more up to date. The reception is just as great as it was with our contract phones too. It's a great basic phone, and if you told me it was a contract phone I would believe you in a second. It has a great feel to it as well. I'm very pleased.",Samsung,"November 20, 2021"

I am sure if one wanted to call Verizon to activate and ask questions about the phone and service, it would be equally satisfactory. My experience is with online activation and teaching my elderly father to use this phone in an emergency. The ring is loud enough to be heard, the speaker is loud enough to be heard and it is small and functional.",Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,"Arrived on time or sooner,in original container as in any store.Also to my surprise ,included ""2"" Freebies ,an car charger and earplug.......

B003FCO9XE,"MY MOM LOVES THIS PHONE, IT SERVED IT'S PURPOSE BUT WHEN WE CHECKED IT, SHE WAS USING ENOUGH MINUTES THAT A PLAN WAS CHEAPER SINCE CALL TO CALL FROM THE SAME COMPANY IS FREE.",Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,"Exactly as described. And exactly what I was looking for. Though I do see what one reviewer was talking about with ""pocket pictures"". The camera on switch is a little too promenant.",Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,The only problem I have is getting a hold of the top to flip the top open to answer it but other then that it is an excellent phone I am happy with it.,Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,"It's got a camera, it's easy to figure out, it allows a thousand one, two, or three button shortcuts (which is overkill, but hey). For the price, it does more than I would've expected.",Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,"The phone was for my mother and she says it's works great! I would give it a 5 star, however, they sent the wrong kind of charger and we had to go out and get another one. Other than that, everything is great!",Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,WAS VERY HAPPY TO GET THE SAME PHONE THAT SOMEONE HAD STOLEN FROM ME GOD BLESS YOU FOR HAVING THIS PHONE,Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,Completely satisfied. Product works well. Shipping was prompt & was received by promised date. Very satisfied.,Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,"I had foolishly expected that something would come with it to let me know how to make it work. But there was nothing at all, and since I've never used a disposable phone, and don't have a regular cell phone, it's worthless to me. Thanks a lot..",Samsung,"November 20, 2021"

B003FCO9XE,Easy to use - works well!,Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,pruduct has eye appeal & nice features.My oops was that I ordered it for my reachout wireless government phone line as an upgrade.I was not aware that verizon makes there own phones where reachout wireless does not & uses other companies phones.if you order a new verizon phone[verizon is reachouts carrier]they will not release that phone to any other company until you have completed a 6 month contract.if you have a reachout government assisted mobil phone & want to upgrade you are better off ordering one out of there website.the phone itself I liked & wish it would have worked for me.an easy 4 stars rating.Sk8rBoi,Samsung,"November 20, 2021"

B003FCO9XE,This phone might be OK for some purposes but was NOT suitable for Page Plus service. It was conveniently returned without problems,Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,"Crawfords Superstore advertised a cell that looked identical to my Verizon flip-top phone, with one exception ... this was a wireless device with online capability, which I don't want (yeah, I know!), I discovered this, reading the packaging, though they had clearly said 'wireless' phone in the ad. (Yeah, I know!) When the phone arrived, I realized my error, and contacted the seller immediately. I sent the phone back pronto. But I have received only generic responses from the seller, Crawfords Superstore, to my communications. Maybe they credited my credit card ... I hope so. But I thought I would get s o m e kind of acknowledgment. Too impersonal. Maybe I am dreaming, expecting communication. Could be; doesn't impress me.",Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,The item was not able to activate. Because the item was already activated by someone. I had to go Verizon service center and spent long time to cancel previous use and activate for my use. Please do clean business. Do not sell used one as a new.,Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,"This phone is fine if you just want to use the prepaid plans, but if you want to activate an existing account (which I did) verizon will not allow you to do that until you have used the prepaid plan on this phone for 6 months. Not for people with existing contracts looking for a cheap way to replace their broken or lost phones. Not too many used options on Amazon for cheap phones, it is better to go to ebay if you want a used phone",Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,You said there was no contract and you have to get a new one too use this !!!!!!!! I have a contract all ready and I just wanted to use this phone temporaley .So I bought this phone for nogthing Not happy !!!!!!!!!,Samsung,"November 20, 2021"

B003FCO9XE,"If you just want a phone to keep in your purse in case of emergencies, this is it. After getting totally fed up with Tracfone, I bought this. It's easy to put money on (which was my gripe with Tracfone. With this phone you program in your credit card number and once a month I punch in $15. Case closed, so to speak), has good reception and battery life, and customer service, the one time I've needed it in almost a year, was great. It's not fancy, but it serves its purpose well. And it can be even fancier than I usually need it to be, with pictures and text. I just bought two for Christmas presents (for 9.99 elsewhere - don't pay Amazon prices!)",Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,"Thank you Samsung for guaranteeing I never buy another cell phone made by you. After 8 months of use, this phone started making beeps when I plugged in the charger and gave spurious warning messages that it had the ""wrong battery"", ""unsupported battery"", even though it would eventually usually recharge. I called Samsung warrantee service, and they made a ticket and UPS label to send in the battery. Within two weeks after I sent it in, they finished the service and sent me an email they had shipped out a replacement. After 3 weeks it hadn't arrived, and when I checked the tracking number, I discovered they'd mailed it to some guy in Florida, not Hawaii. It took me a month of multiple phone calls and submissions on the web to get Samsung Service in Plano, Texas, to send me another battery. When it arrived and I put it in the handset, it displayed the same malfunction. So the problem was in the handset, not the battery. I called Samsung and they told me to send in the handset without the battery or the door, which I did. Three weeks later, I get an email from Samsung that they have received the shipment and ""*** PLEASE DO NOT REPLY TO THIS EMAIL*** We regret to inform you that your Samsung ticket [#####] was rejected due to the following reason. REJECTED - INCOMPLETE KIT The original item will be shipped back to you unrepaired."" and in a separate email, ""Your product was shipped on 20101122 at 102557 EST."" That message, though, was completely erroneous. Nothing was shipped back to me. It was followed by ""We received your Samsung SCH-U350MBPVZW on 11/23/2010 at 12:41 EST"". A week later, I got another message, ""Problem found: LOCK UP DURING OPERATION (SW) SOFTWARE EMERGENCY RECOVERY Solution: S/W Updated Passed All Functional Testing"", and a week after that, the handset arrived back, and now appears to be working. Would I sign up again for such an experience with a cell phone malfunction? No. There were just too many mistakes made here for this to be a fluke. Something is systematically wrong with Samsung USA. I resurrected my Motorola with a cheap OEM battery I got online, which I will continue to use.",Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,"The Samsung Smooth Verizon prepaid phone shocked me when I realized that I bought this phone for $10.00 and I NEVER lose a signal no matter where I go. The phone takes pictures also. Not the best but that is not what I purchased the phone for. This phone has all that I need to communicate with others via text or calling. I can also access GPS, the internet, my emails, look up restraunts in surrounding areas and it has many more features that I did not even know was on the phone when I purchased it. What I also love about this phone is that I text over 1000 texts a month. I only pay $20.00 a month for a text bundle. I sometimes place calls which are short and to the point, less than 5 minutes, I hardly notice my balance dropping at all. The best part is my bill is around $20.00 a month compared to all of the other phones that I've owned which ended up being over $100.00 or closer to $200.00 and they always added in the fees for God only knows what. I love the Samsung Smooth with the Verizon service. Never lose a call or miss one, I can text all day long, every day for only $20.00 a month, and all of the extras that I described above. It is worth every cent that I pay for it.",Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,"I'm on my 3rd one with Verizon -- this one bought new as prepaid, had to wait 6 months to activate with regular Verizon (blocked before that). Excellent phone, but old technology means you can't backup or restore contacts -- verified at a Verizon store. Darn.",Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,This phone has lasted me three years and it's only now starting to cause me problems. And that's probably because I don't treat it too well. I'm most likely going to buy the same phone to replace it.,Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,"The Samsung Smooth has a great battery life and is built well. It is easy to learn and use and has good quality sound. It even has a decent signal at my house even though I live right on the border of a National Park. I get an excellent signal elsewhere. Remember, this is a great basic phone - it is not a Blackberry or a Droid. Bob - Akron OH",Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,"I don't know how I lost this amazing phone but I prefer THIS so-called ""old"" phone to the shiny new iphone. It really is a phenomenal device.",Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,The case is so smooth and tapered it is very hard to grasp to flip open. The keys are also hard to push you have to press just right.,Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,I purchased a Samsung Smooth Verizon cell phone about 7 months ago and remain very happy with it. I needed a cheap plain cell phone to carry with me when traveling and did not want to pay a monthly charge just to have an emergency phone. I put $100 worth of minutes on the phone when I purchased it and 7 months later still have $78 left. As for my limited use this phone has worked very well for me. I even purchased one for a friend to carry with them for emergencies.,Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,"I usually have no problems ordering through amazon. Very happy with your products. But, this one time, I was not satisfied. The phone was not damaged on the outside and you could use all your features. The problem I had is it would not stay charged. I would fully charge the phone, make one call and it would die. Than I could put the phone down for the night, fully charged, in the morning their would be no energy. I could not use this phone.",Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,"No stating that this phone has the old style charge connection,, of which is not compatible with the latest. Meaning- the cord does nt fit into any other amsung device.",Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,"Got the phone for my mom, she needed a cell phone to just make phone calls, she don't text. Received it took it down to Verizon Wireless and got it activated for her. Phone is great for her and there was no hassle activating the phone with Verizon Wireless. If needing a basic phone to use, I highly recommend this phone.",Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,"Brought this phone for my sister, it was her first phone ever. She had no problems with it. For a standard flip phone, it's pretty simplistic. Aside from texting and making calls there's not too much else you can do. Picture quality wasn't the greatest, but considering the price and type of phone, it really wasn't bad.",Samsung,"November 20, 2021"

B003FCO9XE,1) I ordered two identical items. I received one item exactly as ordered and one with an extra attachment. It makes me want the 2nd attachment for the 2nd phone. 2) They arrived quickly and were packaged safely.,Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,I was amazed by how fast my phone was delivered. I received my phone within less than a week. I definitely recommend this seller. Thanks.,Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,This is a great phone i have had it for about a year no problems at all. I accually bought a different phone becuase i wanted a slide phone it has a better rating but its not near as good as this phone.the battery life is amazing last me 2-3 days of use. It has great sound quality. pretty much the best phone cuz there is little things about it that just make everything so easy to use. i give it a 6 out 5 i will buy again,Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,Worst Flip Phone I ever had. It is difficult to open and the sound is terrible. My old LG VX8300 is far better than this phone.,Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,"You can make calls whenever the phone doesn't slip out of your hand. Sound quality's fine, for the first few months. And then it starts to sound like everyone you call is cutting in and out. Are they having phone reception problems? Nope, it's your phone with the problem. The screen is a decent size for a phone at this price, but what's the point when you start getting extra lines across the screen after just a few months of use? The phone does tell time, though.",Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,This prepaid phone is good for emergency situations. Although i wish verizon gave more options with their prepaid plans. You cant get just talk anymore.,Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,"very good, no problems",Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,The phone is OK but the Verizon payment plan extracts a monthly payment whether you use the phone or not. I wasn't aware of the terms until my account was terminated and my $60 balance confiscated. All Verizon support would say was send us more money and we will reactivate your account. My recommendation: go to Walmart.,Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003FCO9XE,When i first looked at the phone it was so bright it made my great grandma go blind. Everyday she would talk about a Giraffe chasing her. When i lift it it turned to celery.,Samsung,"November 20, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"This is a very basic phone, which is what I needed for my daughter going to camp. The ""Product Description"" says it includes $15 of airtime. When I didn't see the $15 in my account after activation I called AT&T, who said this phone does not include any airtime. I then called Amazon who confirmed the $15 airtime claim, but the Amazon rep told me I had to contact Samsung. Unfortunately, the number she gave me was for directory assistance.....I had to call India (I mean Amazon) back. Samsung said I had to deal with either Amazon or AT&T. I have since sent an inquiry to Amazon via email and will update this review. Sounds like someone is lying on the Amazon website. Update..... I just talked with Amazon who said they will give me $15 credit for future Amazon purchases, and will update the product description. When I asked why the 1st rep didn't offer the same solution, which would've saved me an hour of calling (and being on hold), he basically said that that was Amazon's policy and wanted the customer to exhaust all avenues. So, it's better to let customers do all of the legwork for an Amazon mistake and hope they are so frustrated that they simply give-up. Doesn't sound like good customer service to me.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"We have 2 of these (my husband and I each have one) that we use in rural Alaska and they have lasted and lasted and lasted. Nice basic phone--nothing fancy if that's what you're looking for. Ours have been almost indestructible--great battery life, great reception, good size for fitting in a pocket, no screen on the outside to get scratched or broken. We have carried these while doing firewood, in and out of the boat in the ocean air, and dropped them more times than I can count. Trust me--if this was a flimsy phone my husband would have managed to break his a long time ago! We have had other inexpensive go phones that lasted a matter of weeks, not years like these have. I would HIGHLY recommend this phone to anyone who wants a durable, reliable phone that does what a phone is supposed to do.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"Phone works off the AT&T network. After bringing the phone to AT&T, they said it is a 2G network phone which they do not support anymore since 2014. Therefore, the phone will not work with AT&T.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"For my parents visiting, I ordered this phone from a vendor named ""classicsale10"". The shipping was fast. The phone is completely out of date but still meet the basics - calling and texting. The battery lasts long. And it feels good to touch the ""real keys"" again...touch screens are just cold and hard. I only hope this phone would have volume control...and the sound to be louder. Real problem is, the product detail said that this package contains $15 airtime credit. So I activated the phone...and, nothing. Then I waited to see if any msg will come later, like the other buyer said in his/her comment. A night was gone, and still nothing. Then I contacted the seller. They replied by saying that ""AT&T has withdrawn this $15 airtime credit for the devices launched in the market in recent times. The listing was created when the AT&T was giving the free airtime credit. "" Well, although I don't completely understand this but it's not my resposbility for the $15 loss. So after negotiation the seller quickly agreed to refund me $15 though they will lose money. Sorry about that. Blame AT&T, maybe. Anyways, it's a good deal.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"Straight off: SIM card was a dud and had to be replaced at an AT & T store, where I should have gone in the first place. The manual icons are nearly impossible to make out; the menu is not straight-forward; and no mention is made about obtaining a phone number. I ""chatted"" with an on-line agent who was useless, essentially. I just needed an emergency car phone; so this seemed ideal. We'll see.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"Used this as a holdover phone when my old one broke before I could upgrade to my next smartphone. Pros: - Is a phone. - Is cheap. - Good sound quality. Cons: - Doesn't withstand hammers? - Some people apparently have issues with the $15 credit not being applied. If you ask me, $30 for a phone is a great deal regardless.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"This is a very basic cell phone that I purchased as a replacement for my son. He has no interest in taking photos or using the internet with his phone, so it is perfect for him. There is not much else to say about it, it's very basic and it works.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"If you just want a basic phone for talking and you don't expect to talk for more than 80 minutes per month, this is the perfect phone for you. It is compact and simple to use. AT&T's GoPhone option of paying $100 for 1,000 minutes once a year cannot currently be beat.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"this is the second time ive purchased this phone. its a great basic for phone calls, but not much else. its sturdy and the battery lasts a long time. my only disappointment is that this time, the seller didnt offer a $15 airtime credit with the phone purchase. bummer.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"I bought this phone to use it during my holiday in the US. The phone is simple and was used only for calling and sending txt messages (it is possible to download some applications, but I did not test it). The phone had no difficulties to find network in California (from LA to San Francisco), battery held approx. for 10 days (phone was always on, but only few calls were made and few txts sent), quality of sound was very good. The phone fell once on the ground from ca. 1 meter and no harm was made (not even a small scratch). I bought it with 15 USD credit for calls and sms, and taking into account that total phone price was lower than that, it was a great buy.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"The phone/service works well in New York, but in some parts there was no signal. Boston is great and niagara falls worked great. Sound is low so could not hear other person very well but the battery lasts a long time 8+ hours with constant 20 minute calls.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"My mom does not like a complicated phone, and it is nearly impossible to get a non-smart phone. So when her original phone gave out, I bought this an inexpensive replacement. Everyone is happy",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"Bought this for my mom as a substitute phone for a few weeks, and I'm glad that's how long we needed it for, since the phone was pretty much done for after three weeks.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"I received the GoPhone very quickly but unfortunately I hasnt been very reliable. luckily I bought it as an extra phone incase one of our phones (smartphones) started acting up and sure enough, 2 days later, my daughters phone started tripping..the problem is the phone wont allow us to hear the person on the other side. it doesnt happen all the time but once a day is too much. we never know when it will act up also. So i cannot recommend this phone with the experience weve had so far.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"Was looking for a dirt-simple phone. Delivery was excellent - arrived early. Set-up rather confusing. Samsung instructions not the best. ATT is a real PITA! Registration and credit for included minutes took 18 hours and two phone calls. Internet access is the easiest function on the phone - so easy you must be very very careful not to make the connection (and get charged for it!). There is no way to disable this function, so plan on paying for internet minutes whether you want it or not.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"About a week ago I purchased my phone not only was the shipping extremely fast but the phone itself was worth much more than I payed for , it was such an amazing deal that for a while I actually believed it was false until I actually received the phone. The phone came brand new in perfect condition and worked like a charm , all in all Theres not that much to say other than the simple fact that I am extremely happy with this purchase and recommend this seller to everyone and hope to buy from him again. Thanks.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,all is well,Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"I particularly like this phone because it is the physically smallest one I can find. I have difficulty finding replacements because I think they have stopped manufacturing this model. It has a good (severl days) battery life. The various features access is a little primative because you have to go through their tree for access, but that is okay with me.

B003MW0OIQ,"First, I never got to use them because I only received one and, it wasn't new, as advertised, and it didn't come with everything needed to activate. So, I really can't give a high rating or any rating really. I'm very dissatisfied with this purchase.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"

B003MW0OIQ,"Yes, this is a really ancient phone. It does still work and look great, and it was fine for our granddad. Remember, if you buy 1,000 minutes for $100 at AT&T, you'll probably have phone service for a year! If you don't talk much.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"

B003MW0OIQ,Do not buy this phone online I did not get the airtime credit as promised plus you can buy from at&t direct for just $10,Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"I bought this as an emergency phone for my mom, who has a tendency to leave her cell behind (at work, at a relative's house, etc) and no longer has a land line. As such, I expect she will use the phone for a few days every couple of months. The payment plans available are extremely unfriendly for this purpose. All of the available plans are ""use it or lose it"" - minimum deposit is $15 monthly or $25 that expires in 3 months. When the billing period is up, AT&T eats all your unspent funds and you have to pump more into the account in order to use the phone again. There is NO option for people who want to pay only for time used. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised by this, but the ATT reps are apparently coached to be dishonest when setting up the plans as well. I asked the rep I spoke with at least 3 times if there were any hidden fees or monthly minimums, and she said ""no"" three times. After making an additional deposit I get on the web site and learn about the ""expiration date"" on money deposited. If you were planning to use this phone as a backup, plan to spend at least $100 a year in fees just to keep the phone accessible for emergency use.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"Just got this phone for when my mom-in-law is visiting from Taiwan. Looks like a good basic phone. Voice quality during test calls in our house was decent. My main issue is with the included $15 Airtime Credit. There was no Pay As You Go card included, after activation I could not make any calls, and AT&T's web site claimed ""Need Initial Refill,"" so I ""refilled"" my phone account via credit card with $15. About *two hours* after activation, I received an SMS that the original $15 Airtime Credit was added to my account. Had I known, I would not have ""refilled"" my account.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"Only my wife has my cell phone number and we do not call one another often. I always renew my GoPhone account with lots of minutes remaining. Good to have a phone on me in case of emergencies or if I need to further irradiate my brain with microwaves. Have a Nokia 6030 ""candy bar"" phone I was happy with, EXCEPT the exposed keypad permitted a lot of ""butt dialing."" So, I went to RadioShack (R.I.P.) and bought the cheapest GSM phone they had w/o a contract. The Samsung was $16 on sale and the RadioShack employee offered to swap out my SIM chip and transfer all my phone information onto the Samsung. The Samsung's covered keypad eliminated ""butt dialing."" Signal strength and clarity are worse on the Samsung. One day my battery ran down and I needed it to meet an appointment. Did not have a spare battery so I attempted to swap the SIM card back to the Nokia. SAMSUNG DESIGNED IT SO YOU CANNOT REMOVE THE SIM CARD. I got customer support at samsung.com/us/support/ . FAQ had illustrations on how to remove it. Didn't work... (I sold technology for 30 years so I know how to troubleshoot and repair electronics.) A ""Tech Chat"" window popped up on samsung.com/us/support/ I gave her the problem, the same FAQ page appeared and POOF, the Customer NO SUPPORT person was gone... Relogged onto the site gave another customer rep the problem and told them NOT to show me the FAQ page again. I got told to take the phone to the phone center since the FAQ did not work. I thanked Customer NO SUPPORT and left. Got a cheap ginsu steak knife I was taking to Goodwill and bent the tip. I was able to pursuade the SIM out. If grading on a curve I would give the phone and Samsung a ""D-""",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"I have one of these. Initially bought back when my original AT&T Samsung Impression went kaput. I have now been on a smartphone kick, progressing from the MB860 Atrix 4G to the MB865 Atrix 2 (This was actually a downgrade from the 4G unfortunately, it sucked) and now onto the MB886 Atrix HD. Back onto the subject oof the A107: Call quality was good-to-excellent: Never dropped a call, others heard me loud and clear, hearing them was loud and clear as well. If I recall, this does have a speakerphone through use of the ear receiver. Features were poor/lacking: It was able to call and text, I'm not sure I remember ever being able to connect to the internet on it however. I know it's not an HSPA/EVDO device (3G) but I should have still been able to pull up a single page on Google or Yahoo, however that was not capable even on the 1X data connection. Reliability was excellent: The phone still works to this very day, it's never bugged out on me or not turned on or made a call when I wanted & needed it to. Ruggedness was excellent: I am notorious for dropping my phones. I have dropped this thing numerous times but it functions perfect, the only thing apparent is the scuffs and marks on the outside of the case. Battery life was excellent: I remember using this phone for days with plenty of talk and text going on and not having to charge it very often at all. When I did charge it, I'd charge it overnight (8~hours) and use it until it was about dead again. It would last for days though, I am positive on that. *Not sure about if you're seeing this at the $27 price I am now, but I can honestly say I'd hold off on it for that price. I got mine for $19 + tax in Wal-Mart years back.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"I bought this phone as a step in porting my land line phone to Google Voice. (For some reason Google can only port cell phone numbers.) So first I port my home phone to this cell phone and then to Google. Details of this process are all over the web so I won't repeat them here. I didn't intend to really use it for calls which is a good thing because the phone is really cheap. This phone is almost unusable for voice calling. Don't get the idea that this is a good choice for anything but a backup to your backup phone used only if you were stranded on a desert island. I suppose it could be used by kids who mostly text since that part of the phone is pretty standard. Setup was simple following the instructions in the box. It did take at least 10 minutes to activate. it turns out to be only $0.10/min and $0.20/text. Probably heavy text users would go for one of the /day or /month plans. They seem to charge for everything but calling 611. For example, it looks like even if the phone is forwarded they charge for the call time.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"These are $10 +$2 S&H at Walmart's online store, $3 more in-store. The only way I found to import my contacts was by copying them onto my SIM card from an old phone. No software available from Samsung, no iSync support - even from third parties, nothing from Google or Yahoo. (Please add a comment if you come across anything@) TIP: If you don't want to get charged for Internet usage ever, call up AT&T, get a Customer Service Agent and tell them you want to block all data/Internet access. They'll warn you that this will also disable MMS (Picture/sound/video messaging) but since you can't send such messages anyway, this is probably not a big deal. **Now I don't have to worry about being charged every time I press the wrong button and it starts.** I use my Verizon MiFi with my MacBook Pro, iPod or iPad for mobile 'net access. Service: I recommend the $2/day plan. You can use this as a backup phone - make most of your calls from anywhere over the Internet (via wireless hotspot and iPod touch, smartphone with WiFi - e.g. most Android, iOS or Symbian phones.) It's best to use with Google Voice ; my GV # is my main phone # that I give out. If the 'net connection isn't on, this lets me know if anyone calls, or texts, and then I can take the call on this phone or on another device. Texting from an iPad is a GREAT experience compared to any cellphone. Cell Phone: The phone very cheap and yet it is quite sturdy. It's about the simplest phone you can buy. This phone just lets you make calls and send/receive text messages, plus a few tools like alarms and calculators. No headset jack, volume controls, camera, crash-prone operating system, No time-sucking learning curve. Final Word: I generally don't use more than $25 per 3 months. Plus, you can buy $25 cards at a discount if you shop around. The phone serves my needs and I am very satisfied with it. But, smartphones are getting cheaper and cheaper...",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"My phone on our family plan got stolen and I did not want to spend a lot of money on a temporary replacement phone. So I go this prepaid phone, went to ATT and they made me a new sim card for free and I popped it in this phone. Eventually my stolen phone was recovered so I just took the sim out and put it in the recovered phone. More recently I washed my good phone in the laundry, but the sim still worked so I just popped it back in this handy spare. It is a simple phone with no fancy features. There is no camera, but you can get online and check email. I've also dropped it several times and it hasn't broke yet, so I say it is worth it especially for a clumsy person or a kid or if you just need a spare.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"I did not buy this phone here but at Wal-Mart. I do not use the Go-Phone system but used my existing SIM card from my old phone with my AT&T monthly plan. A lot of 1 star reviews complain about the Go-Phone payments plans which I do not utilize. My wife and I each have our own cell phones and hers is used as our main phone number, we do not have a land line anymore. I don't call people much anymore since I retired so I needed a simple phone without all the bells and whistles. For a good inexpensive phone used as a secondary line it is well worth the money. I have had it for 1 year and no problems with it to speak of.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"My stepson lost his mother's cellphone. The phone, which my wife did not like much anyway, was on my family plan. My wife prefers clamshell phones so my plan to pass her down my IPhone 3GS was not met with any enthusiasm. So how did I get her a new cellphone, one she likes, put it on the plan, and not extend my plan by another two years? This phone is the answer. First it's a clamshell. Second it is priced right. Third, AT&T will put in a new SIM card for her family plan number. Finally none of this extends my existing plan should I want to switch providers (and I am not sure I do since AT&T is getting better). Now please note that by installing a new SIM card, this becomes a regular cellphone on my plan. It is no longer a prepaid phone. The voice quality is quite good. It has a camera, which my wife is unlikely ever to use. It has what it calls ""Apps"" was are a few limited and unimaginative mini-programs. It can text, another feature my wife won't use, and has a means to download a few MP3s. An iPhone it's not. My wife can use it, and we can communicate, and that's all that really counts.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"Pros: I've been using this phone for a year. It does everything I essentially need to do on a phone: take calls, save contacts, receive texts. Go phone service with AT&T is great and cheap with this phone. Cons: 1. I don't think AT&T bundles this phone anymore with the service so be careful when purchasing it. 2. Very weak vibrate. I'm a student so I always keep my phone on vibrate (in fear that my phone will go off during lecture). This is annoying: when I'm walking, I cannot feel this phone vibrate in a my pocket. 3. I know its this phone because others with AT&T service get reception when I don't in Boston. Sometimes even if I'm standing outside I cannot get good reception.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"I bought two of these phones for my wife and I directly from the AT&T store because we moved in an area that AT&T had a monopoly and our Verizon phones wouldn't get signal. (Feels like this shouldn't even be legal in this day and age but that's another story.) These phones are very confusing to navigate and even the graphics feel like they are about five years behind the times. But I didn't expect much for what I paid so I can't complain too much about that. Unfortunately after less than three months my wife's phone completely stopped working. It made noise like someone was calling when they weren't, it couldn't complete calls, and the battery wouldn't hold a charge for more than about twelve hours without even using it. Because it was more than 30 days I would have to do a warranty replacement rather than exchange it. I decided that it wasn't even worth my time to warranty replace it since I didn't like the phone to begin with. Unless price is your only concern in buying a phone (it was my main concern when I bought this) I recommend paying a bit more and getting a better phone. I'll be keeping my phone simply because I'm not to the type to waste money when mine still works but I won't be disappointed when it breaks and I have to buy a better phone.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"You get a star, Samsung, for having a SIM card slot in a prepaid phone. You get a star for having a 'random-background' feature, even though you can't set downloaded/texted images to be random. You lose a star for having a completely unconfigurable menu. You lose a star for having two unconfigurable face-buttons which default to online services. You lose a star for having extensive battery problems not 6 months into my owning of this phone. It's true. Merely shutting the clam-shell apparently jars the battery contacts out of place 3 times out of 4. If you plan on owning this phone for more than 6 months, be prepared to turn your phone on again every time you open it up.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"I bought one of these and it started buzzing w/o stopping 4 days after warranty ended. Junk, no more Samsung for me.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"

B003MW0OIQ,I've been using this phone for a month now. The phone calls are clear and it is easy to use. The ATT service has been fine too. The best part is the price! I definitely recommend this phone.,Samsung,"June 24, 2021"

B003MW0OIQ,I'm a at&t customer in a contract and have 6 months to go. I dropped my phone and it broke a bit so I decided to get this phone for $11.15 at radio shack. I just inserted my phone's sims card. There's nothing extraordinary about the phone just very basic either way I just need it for texting. If you still have a year to go on your contract(no insurance)I suggest you invest at least $50 to get a better gophone.,Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"at&te lost is totally off my list forever. The pre-pay money you fork over in advance will be lost if you do not re-new and that usually means they want more money each period. I lost over $125 to the scum because we do not use the phone except for emergencies. at&t was real happy to tell me to fork over more money even though I had only used 5 minutes of time in a year. I told them to go suck an egg and I will go to great lenght to avoid anything to help at&t. I replaced their service with a service that does not rip off your unused minutes. So, folks, if you want my advice avoid them and save some money and headaches",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"

B003MW0OIQ,"I purchased this phone since AT&T is the only provider that covers where I recently relocated to. If you like to spend hours on end destroying your eyes watching youtube or obsessing over your friends on facebook, this isn't the phone for you. Its a phone that is alas...just a phone. Having owned, broken, and lost numerous smartphones, I told myself that all I needed was a phone that I could toss in my messenger bag and not want to kill myself if I lost it. Not a small portable computer, and a phone that wasnt big enough to act like a blinder on a horse when talking on it. This fit those requirements to a T. Don't get me wrong, I am not an old guy that resists change and innately hates technology, I am 27 years old. For going online, watching stupid videos, or doing other computer related stuff...I kinda like to use a computer. This phone turns on, turns off, calls people, receives calls, and on the rare occasion that texting seems more convenient than calling, it does that too! So its a phone that works as a phone should work, and for $17 if I lose it ill just get another..",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"I bought this phone for my grandfather who does not need a sophisticated smart phone. He just needs a reliable phone and no need to be in a long term contract with such a phone. Yes, Go Phones, can be used by those with regular service. You simply use you current SIM card and dispose of the one that comes with the phone. The call clarity has been great, as well as the reception. I expect about a 2 to 3 year life out of the phone for him. He says the buttons are a little small for him with regards to the numbers written on the buttons, but otherwise it's a very solid phone for him.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"

Nowhere to be found. Not in package. Not in phone. Not in shipping box. Thus, this probably fine cell phone was useless. Unusable.

B003MW0OIQ,This is the fourth one of these that we have had in the family over the last 5 years and each of us have enjoyed using them. Hold up very well and are easy to use all the functions. The owners manual does a good job of explaining things.,Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"Thsi phone is great! My contract phone started having problems with charging and I cannot get a new phone for 9 months. This one fits the bill, I just slipped in the sim card and it is ready to go. Pleanty of features for a phone of this price!",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,Good GoPhone.,Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"After ordering it I found it expensive and a hassle to refill the minutes,can't find the phone now any way",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"This was a good sale. Phone works great. Delivery was immediate and the price was right. If you just need a cell phone for emergency like I do, you can't go wrong with this one.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,I think is a new one but its use,Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"This is a low end phone, and it is what I was expecting when I bought it. Good phone, and works fine.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,Nice phone,Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,Do not buy this junk. You cannot adjust the volume so as to hear voice at the other end!!!!! JUNK!,Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,no coment,Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,This is my 2nd one of this type and we love it for just it's simplicity when you just need a phone and not all the smartphone options. Love it!,Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,I love it,Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,Your going to need a magnifying glass to see the screen,Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,could use a photo shooter,Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,Very small and screen is tiny.,Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,very small and light. much smaller and lighter than i had expected. bought it for my daughters 13th birthday. so far works really well and she is getting really good at texting,Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"The item arrived in a broken box, with a label taped to the item labeled ""defective item"" and handwritten ""won't work"". It is obviously a used and broken item. I opened the package to wrap the item for my sweetie on Christmas Eve, and now I have no Christmas present for him.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"I thought I was getting some minutes with this prepaid phone. Not so. I inserted the SIM card, charged the battery, and chose a plan according to the instructions, but it would not receive SMS (text) messages. I called customer service, who told me that my account was empty and that I had to purchase minutes either right there with my credit card, or go to an ATT store. I went to the ATT store where they told me that I could have bought the exact same Samsung phone there, same deal, same choice of calling plans, for TEN BUCKS! So I paid over THREE TIMES too much buying it here! Thanks, Amazon!",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"This is NOT a prepaid Go Phone as Described. It has no airtime on the SIM card. The ATT options to put money on the phone are ridiculous. The least you can do is put $10/month on the phone, which is what I pay for unlimited calls on our family plan now. Find a REAL go phone with minutes loaded on it; this is a rip off and insults my intelligence.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,The seller sent this phone out the same day I ordered it and I received it in 2 days!!! What a blessing. It came and was like new. I would definitely recommend this seller.,Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"I have had one of these phones for several years. It is a superb phone, and for use only to make calls, I don't think you could ask for more. The only reason I am getting rid of mine is that my service will no longer support a 2G phone after the end of 2016! It doesn't get good reception except for one place in the house. However, neither do my friends ""smart phones"" when in a marginal reception area such as where I live. Otherwise, the reception is great and the battery charge seems to last forever. It doesn't have a camera, which is the only other feature I would like, but for what it is, you just won't find a better value. I have dropped it on tile floors and concrete several times with no apparent damage. What is shame that none of the manufacturers don't offer a 3 or 4 G phone this size any more. Its small size and rounded corners enable it to fit into the smallest pocket. What a shame it will go into history.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"This phone is a dinosaur. Technology has made it obsolete. There is nothing you can really do on this phone, especially with respect to the internet that is interesting. As far as the craftsmanship goes, that is the reason for giving this phone 3 stars only, as one should totally forget about using this phone for the internet because it lacks the computing technology. Below is my old review: I Can't Speak More Highly of This Phone. I have tried more expensive phones, but this one is just right because I like a simple cell phone with internet capabilities. I love its almost only text browsing. That is, you will be able to view some pictures in color, but not with a great deal of clarity. I use my SGH-a107 for text email, text news (like NPR or CNN), and as an emergency phone. Usually, I spend about $25 on it every month, but if there is a $15 card, I can get away with spending that much. A 100MB package should do it for the first month, and then with rollover, you can buy less expensive internet packages. It is almost impossible to use up 100MB on this phone, and I use my internet daily for hours on end. Sometimes my hands are shaky, and that makes typing on one of those mini-keypads on the more expensive phones nearly impossible for me. Not only that, this phone fits in my hands well. That is, when I use other phones for hours on end, my thumbs hurt. However, with this phone, there is no pain. Once you get used to its typing features, typing a message on it is a snap! Thanks Samsung and AT&T! I have had this phone now for a few years and still love it!",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"I've just bought this phone over the past weekend at BB for $15 and bought $25 airtime. Service: So far, I have to say I am quite happy with it. I previously had T-Mobile prepaid but had to switch because I had no service in my house. After switching to AT&T, I can actually make calls/texts in my house. The service is quite cheap as well, I am on the Simple Rate plan. It costs $.10/min to talk which gets deducted from your prepaid balance. Standard texting costs $.25 per text, but I bought 200 messages for $4.99 that lasts for 30 days (Comes to $.02/text). Cell Phone: The phone was super cheap and yet it is quiet sturdy. There is no exterior screen, making it that much more stable/energy efficient. It is quite possibly the simplest phone you can buy new on the market. It does not have the capacitive touchscreen that you will find on an iPhone, it does not have an HD screen, nor does it let you scroll through the internet like you would on your computer. Instead, this phone lets you make calls and send/receive text messages. Crazy right? It is not made to be the shiny object that attracts the nearby fishes and sheep, it is simply a mobile phone for communicating. My only quip is that is has no volume control buttons on the side, not a huge issue, just something I would have liked. I also use the phone as my alarm to wake up. Final Word: I estimate that it will cost me about $10-15 a month for their service a month. I usually text a lot more than I make calls, but I spend no more than 100-150 minutes a month which equals $10-15. Now that I have the $4.99 texting package, I will probably reduce my minutes, making it go down to 50-10 minutes. The phone serves is purpose, I am very satisfied with it. I'd give it 5 stars if it had a volume control button the side, it doesn't so I'll live without it but it is not perfect. It meets all my criteria of needs, nothing else to say.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"Bought this to use when my phone stopped working. It is a great phone for everyday use. After my phone was repaired, I kept this as a backup and use it when I go hiking, etc., so as not to damage my regular phone. It's old tech, but I love it because: *Works with your existing AT&T SIM card *Plug and play *compact UPDATE (12/15/2015) Still using this phone on a regular basis and have used it almost daily for 3 years. Has developed a problem with send key not registering on the first push, but overall, functionality is good. I am surprised that I can still depend on this phone. For the longevity of use, I would choose this again as a basic phone.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"even though, right on the order page, it says ""two phones available"" or whatever number, you order this, and then wait about 4 days, then Amazon emails you and tells you that there are none available. I am just trying to find a phone with buttons large enough for me to read with my bifocals necessary sight, and most of the phones have buttons too small. the flip phones don't, but AT&T doesn't seem to be interested in selling those models. every time I try to order one, the order is cancelled.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"I purchased this phone as a stop-gap since my old phone broke after four years and I wasn't due for an upgrade with my service for eight months. It's not exactly fair to pick on a $9.99 phone but since all I expected were basic functions and this one failed to deliver, I thought I had to comment. Most importantly, the phone I purchased started to shut off by itself after a few months causing me to miss incoming calls and texts. Then, even when it was on, texts sent to me in the morning would show up late in the day, as would voice mail messages and missed call indicators. I ended up replacing the phone and all of these problems disappeared so I can't seem to fault my network provider. Again, $9.99 is not a lot to pay for a phone, but making and receiving calls when I wish is not a lot to expect from a cellular device at any price. You'll save money with this phone but you'd be better off saving yourself a lot of aggravation by purchasing a different product.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"UPDATE- THIS PHONE WILL NO LONGER WORK WITH ATT GO PHONE SERVICE AS OF DECEMBER 2016 -WE WERE JUST NOTIFIED BY ATT--- BUT THEY DID REPLACE WITH A NEW PHONE which is a bit bigger and heavier so I guess we can't complain. I also heard from one of their reps on the phone that GO PHONE Service will also be going up in December, so we may switch our service elsewhere! ATT is moving up to 3G and maybe 4G and this phone only handles 2G so that is why it no longer will work.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,I paid only $2.99 when it was on sale. The ring tone sound is not loud at all. It is only a basic cell phone for anyone who only needs to make phone call on a as needed basis. Forget texting or web surfing. This phone is definitely for phone calls only. I was going to give it to my kid as a backup phone. I hated this phone so much I use it as an alarm clock. I am giving this phone two stars because it allows the users to set up six alarms.,Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,Works now and then. Don't expect too much from a cheap phone and you won't be disappointed. Being cheap and buying this cheap phone has probably caught up with me. I saw Walgreens stocked this model for under 10 bucks and they weren't exactly flying off the shelves. UPDATE: I fixed the loose battery and now it works great.. so I now take back everthing I said.,Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"I've used this phone for a few years, sometimes as my daily phone, sometimes as a backup when another phone doesn't work. It is what it is, a low priced prepaid phone. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles so I recommend it for those who don't want a fancy gadget, or someone who prefers a simple, easy-to-use device. My only issue with the phone is call quality. Sometimes it's a little difficult to hear what others are saying, especially in slightly noisier environments, and sometimes others have a difficult time hearing me. Sometimes it takes a few retries to get a text to send, but I think that's cell phone signal here in this building ... But then again for less than $20 really hard to go wrong.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"I can review only the hardware, because I placed my AT&T SIM card into the phone. But I can tell you that the phone is awful, becoming unusable within two months of purchase. The phone will still connect, but all outgoing calls carry no voice. This means that my outgoing calls connect, but I am unable to hear the other person and they cannot hear me. Nor is this an isolated incident. A close friend had the same phone, and it broke in the same way, although it broke after four months -- compared to my two months. In short, look elsewhere for a reliable phone. This one is not worth your money.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"It appears the later manufactured models of this phone have a manufacturers defect in that calls come in but you cannot hear the person when you answer and it's the same when placing a call. It works sometimes but not all the time. I had two of these phones beginning in 2010 and then in 2011, both lasted about 8 months each. I have this year, 2012, just bought two more which both do not work from the get go. I bought them on ebay and wasted my money. The only reason i bought this phone was to be able to add calls and text from certain people onto reject list, a nice feature this phone has and other phones should have it too!!!",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,my iphone broke so i bought this to use until iphone5 comes out whenever. i use this for calls and texts and it is fine. what else do you expect for a 16 dollar phone? i think it is worth the money and its fuctions are exactly what you pay for. i have no complaints.,Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,I broke rugby phone...which was AT&T contract phone.....I love this phone for the price...it ring loud ...you can hear the persons very Loud on conversation ....took the SIM card our of the rugby. Works well with the contract SIM card in it.,Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,"I purchased this phone and it is really limited. The quick keys and navigation to get to your text area or your messaging center are cumbersome. You may be thinking, 'but it's an inexpensive phone? What do you want?"" Well, I'm glad you asked. The main (and most frustrating) aspect of this phone is that if you do not hold the mouth piece directly in front of your mouth, the other person listening on the other end will not be able to hear you. Even if I hold the end of the phone near my chin, there's massive fade out. So, if you get this phone, you'd better be mechanical in how you hold it. Really disappointing since I am usually a Samsung fan.",Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
B003MW0OIQ,I purchased this phone in late July 2011 after my razor stopped working (had the razor 3 years). Earlier this month (November 2011) the outside light stopped working so I could no longer see the clock. This weekend (November 13) the inside light went out so that I can no longer see the numbers when I dial. From late July to Early November I've had this phone about 3 months and a week or so; I'm very unhappy and would not recommend it to anyone.,Samsung,"June 24, 2021"
